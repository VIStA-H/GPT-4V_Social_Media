Needs of the amateur game very different to the pro

This'll help, indeed, Ripper. I think Owen Williams' defence would be up to it., indeed Andy. Or Owen Williams. I'd love to see a second distributor at 12, Key to Wales performing well could be the selection at 13. 

Not 7.

Jon Davies having a poor season by his standards., yup. Although Jonny Gray has the work rate of 2. Young Alun-Wyn Jones in the making., indeed, Mike. But I genuinely believe that the Scottish backline have four tries in them over 80 mins., Don't understand the discord between Brisbane Tens organisers &amp; NZRU

I know the rest periods for ABs &amp; I live in Cardiff, Some  brain squirts 

- Ireland won't beat Scotland 
- England won't beat Wales 

Which means the slam is off for the big 2, Scot v Ire could spin the 6Ns on its head

By no means a given for Ireland 

Scottish backline easily capable of scoring 4 tries, tricky. Plays/ played three positions to test standard. Not many can do that, Matt Giteau leaving is the last vertebrae of Toulon's 2012 spine being removed. 

Hayman, Bakkies B, Wilkinson, Giteau. 

Rebuild required., In reality, 3 out of 5  wins is a minimum requirement for Wales

2 home games and Italy away, Joe Marler must have been drinking Araldite for the past month

Awesome recovery from a leg fracture, Joe Marler being fit is a massive boost for England

Eddie J will be very happy with that, Can't wait for the  

Huge tournament for Rob Howley &amp; his squad 

Much will be decided as a result, Six Nations special out tomorrow 👊👊👊👊⬇️, I'm going for a full Prince Albert, Mike ☺️, I haven't played for 15 odd years.
