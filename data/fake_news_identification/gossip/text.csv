0,"Brad Pitt & Neri Oxman: Amal Clooney Reportedly Introduced Brad To His New Gal Pal Did Amal Clooney set up new friends Brad Pitt and Neri Oxman? Brad was allegedly looking for a new pal just like George Clooney’s wife, and she reportedly knew just the person!

Amal Clooney‘s basically perfect — incredibly intelligent, massively successful, a humanitarian, and devastatingly beautiful. Naturally, Brad Pitt would want to be around someone like the famed human rights attorney married to his good friend, George Clooney. That’s why Brad allegedly sought Amal’s help in finding a new friend, according to an anonymous source who spoke to OK! Magazine. “Amal knows Neri through mutual friends and thought she and Brad would be the perfect fit,” the source said.

Don’t get your hopes up about these new friends, though. Brad and Neri’s friendship is strictly professional, and he was actually referred to her because of her amazing credentials, a source told HollywoodLife. Reports about Brad and Neri’s friendship started at the beginning of April, with Page Six claiming that the two met through an architecture project at MIT, where Neri’s a professor.

Even if there were sparks between the two, Neri would never pursue a romantic relationship, a source close to the professor told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY “Neri is feeling the pressure of spending time with Brad. She feels like all eyes are on her in Boston and she is getting more attention than ever before. Friends and family are constantly asking her about Brad which is something that she did not expect.” Totally understandable. Going from academia to potential celebrity status would be hard as hell for someone to experience! One thing we do hope is true about this friendship — the OK! source’s claim that Brad’s “the happiest he’s been in a long time.” We want that for him so badly!",0

2,"Revealing Details About Prince William and Prince Harry’s Royal Feud With Camilla Royal feuds are as old as the throne itself.

Prince William and Prince Harry have known of their stepmother, Camilla, since very early in their lives. The high-profile and public affair between Camilla and Prince Charles is something the boys will never truly forget. Understandably, they have had a rocky relationship with Camilla over the years. Some years have been better than others, but it’s impossible to completely erase the dark history between each other.

Let’s take a quick look at the revealing details behind the relationship between Prince William, Prince Harry, and Camilla, including a major sign of progress for their relationship (No. 9). We’ll also discuss the surprisingly blunt statement from Prince William (No. 12).

1. William was resistant to meeting Camilla

In the summer of 1997, two months before Diana’s death, Charles sat his kids down to talk to them about Camilla. He explained their relationship from his point of view, but Diana had already tainted the mere thought of Camilla for the boys. William was especially resistant to meeting her. Charles did not push the relationship on the boys because he wanted them to warm up to her and knew they were aware of the trouble Camilla had caused Charles and Diana.

Next: William took the initiative.

2. William eventually set up a meeting with Camilla to clear the air

After taking a break from pushing the boys to meet Camilla, Charles tried once more. In 1998, William finally agreed to set up a meeting with Camilla so he could learn a little more about her. Afterward, both agreed that things went well. However, Camilla was not yet out of the woods with William. There was still a lot he wanted to know.

Next: The brothers did not meet her at the same time.

3. Harry let William get to know her first

Harry did not attend the meet up with William. Instead, he met Camilla a few weeks later over tea. The two were at Highgrove, Charles’ home. Camilla’s children were present as well, and it was reportedly more casual than her meeting with William. Tensions were not as high, possibly since William had gotten to know Camilla a bit and filled Harry in.

Next: Diana made no bones about her feelings.

4. Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons

It was evident that Diana was not OK with the affair between Charles and Camilla. She quickly confronted Camilla about it and reportedly let her sons know, too. She referred to him as “Charles’ lady” to her sons. The boys immediately got a bad taste in their mouths about Camilla, which likely led to a years-long, up-and-down relationship with their father’s current wife.

Next: Things did not improve too quickly.

5. The relationship was still rocky at Charles’ 50th birthday party

The boys organized a birthday party for Charles when he was turning 50. They made the nice gesture of inviting Camilla to sit with Charles. However, it’s been reported that their relationship was still very tentative at the time. The boys wanted to make progress with Camilla but still felt shadowed by how she had split up their mother and father.

Next: This person may have had an influence on the boys, too.

6. The queen may have delayed the brothers’ acceptance of Camilla

At Charles’ party, Camilla sat with him, and the whole family celebrated his milestone birthday. The one missing person? The queen. She refused to attend the event knowing Camilla would be present. The queen had still not accepted her son’s infidelity. Her hesitation toward letting Camilla join the family may have fueled additional hesitation from William and Harry.

Next: Charles took a big step with this invitation.

7. A family vacation built some connection

William, Harry, and Charles were set to fly to Greece to spend a vacation together. Charles invited Camilla to attend. She accepted the invitation and flew to Greece with the family. While it is unclear exactly what happened there, it appeared that the boys enjoyed the time spent with their father and Camilla.

Next: Things were looking up for Camilla and the boys.

8. By the time Camilla and Charles married, her relationship with the boys had greatly improved

Camilla wed Charles in 2005. After the wedding, Harry had nothing but good things to say about his new stepmother. “[Camilla is] a wonderful woman who makes my father very, very happy,” Harry said in an interview with BBC. “William and I love her to bits.” He also reinforced that they do not see her as a wicked stepmother.

Next: William played a big role in his father’s second wedding.

9. William served as his father’s ‘best man’

While William had fewer comments about Camilla than Harry, his brother did say that both of them loved Camilla very much. Although “best man” is not a traditional wedding position in England — groomsmen are typically called “supporters” — William served as Charles’ best man equivalent in the wedding. When Charles asked, William accepted without much hesitation.

Next: This gift from Camilla symbolized a harmonious family.

10. Camilla gave Kate Middleton a gift at William and Kate’s wedding

When William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, Camilla gave Kate a special wedding gift. It was a gold charm bracelet with each of their initials engraved on either side. Kate sported the bracelet on multiple occasions, as if to say that she was happy to have Camilla in the family. It seemed as though the feud between Charles’ children and Camilla had finally ended.

Next: … but things have not been perfect since.

11. The brothers were silent at Camilla’s 70th birthday celebration

The Daily Mail recently reported that at Camilla’s 70th birthday celebration, no words were said by the brothers. Most people expected the brothers to make a public statement about their stepmother, whom they had once seemed to fully patch things up with. Instead, they stayed silent, leading people to question whether things had changed between the three.

Next: This statement from William hints at an unstable relationship.

12. William made it clear that his children only have two grandmothers

2017 marked 20 years since the tragic death of William’s mother, Princess Diana. In Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, William made it clear that Camilla was not a grandmother to his two children. “… [I] just try and remind them that there are two grandmothers — there were two grandmothers — in their lives,” he said. William did not mention Camilla when speaking about the childrens’ grandmothers, even though she was their grandfather’s wife and had known them since birth, just like Kate’s mother.

Next: It appears the tides have turned.

13. More than a decade later, the relationship ‘has changed’

A source later confirmed to the Daily Mail that things have not been the same between Camilla and the boys in recent years. “They are not close to Camilla anymore,” said a friend of the royal family. “The relationship has changed.” Other friends of the family have backed up those claims. One person, an old friend of Diana’s, said, “It was pretty clear they don’t have a good word for Camilla.”

Next: The boys don’t want Camilla gaining this role.

14. They likely do not want Camilla to be named queen

The public has made it clear that when Charles is passed the throne and becomes king, Camilla should not be queen. That was supposed to be Diana’s role, and the public remains loyal to her. They have also declined to call Camilla “Princess of Wales” because that was Diana’s title. Since the boys have seemed to distance themselves from Camilla, it’s likely that they do not want her to be queen, either. Rumors have swirled that the feud has heated up again since it was suggested that William and Kate take the role, but those rumors have not been confirmed.

Next: This one thing could be a big reason for their resistance.

15. The boys never fully came to terms with their mother’s death

In Diana, Our Mother, Harry and William went into detail about how little they actually cried over their mother. Harry made a comment that he still felt like there was much more he had to let out about her death. Since the boys seemed to never properly mourn their mother, they may have never had that closure that would allow them to let another mother into their lives. Plus, Camilla caused Diana so much pain that not having the closure of her death might make it even more difficult to let someone like that in.

Next: Is there already a feud between Camilla and Meghan Markle?

16. For starters: Why would they fight?

Meghan and Camilla can’t possibly know each other very well. And Camilla recently gushed over the engagement to Prince Harry. So why would a feud be on the horizon? As one online rag alleges, the Duchess of Cornwall has never thought the American actress was worthy of marrying into the royal family.

Next: Trying to decipher how a feud might have started.

17. Why would Camilla think of Meghan this way?

For starters, Camilla supposedly isn’t fond of Meghan because she is American and does not come from a royal background. (Camilla allegedly felt the same way about Kate Middleton entering the royal family, so there could potentially be some truth to this rumor.) It is also rumored that Camilla wasn’t a fan of Meghan dumping her boyfriend of two years the second she met Harry, seeing it as a social climbing move. (Something Meghan’s stepsister has also accused her of.)

Next: Seeing if a fight interrupted the engagement timeline.

18. Was the engagement really postponed?

According to Inquisitr, Camilla flew to Toronto in the summer of 2017 to tell Meghan in person that she should not accept a marriage proposal from Harry. And that, if Meghan accepted, the Camilla would “make life difficult” for her. While Harry and Meghan announced their engagement later in the year, it was alleged that Camilla’s meddling pushed things back.

Next: Examining the lengths Camilla might have gone to.

19. Has Camilla continued to cause trouble?

New Idea claims that Camilla didn’t stop at trying to sabotage the engagement. The site alleges that the duchess is responsible for at least 14 key staffers at Buckingham Palace resigning, which in turn postponed the early stages of planning the wedding. It’s also said that Prince Harry was livid and supposedly confronted his stepmother about the matter. (Of course, this is all from “well-placed sources” and it isn’t completely clear if this rumor is true.)

Next: Relating the allegations to previous rumors.

20. Has Camilla meddled like this before?

As it turns out, this isn’t the first time that Camilla has been accused of trying to ruin a royal wedding. Gossip columns pointed their fingers at her back in 2011 for allegedly trying to interfere with Prince William and Kate Middleton’s relationship. It was said that Camilla had confidantes leak lies about Kate to the tabloids in order to paint her in a bad light.

Next: Speaking of Duchess Catherine …

21. What does Kate think?

Here’s where things get interesting. One gossip rag claims that the Duchess of Cambridge and the future royal have joined forces to kick Camilla out of the royal family. Another gossip site, Gossip Cop, says that story is untrue because it has “inside sources” telling it the claim is 100% not true. (Although if you read the bottom of that post, it appears this could just be a case of two tabloids fighting with each other.)

Next: Only one questions remains …

22. Will we ever know the truth?

Unless Meghan unleashes a right hook that connects with Camilla’s jaw, we’ll likely never know if the two are actually at odds or not. Surely there will be a million photographers trying to catch Camilla glaring in Meghan’s direction at the wedding. Or body language experts deciphering how uncomfortable they look standing next to each other. But for now, all we have is the good ol’ rumor mill.

Take That Tom! Katie Holmes Embraces Therapy & Jamie Foxx To Get Revenge On Cruise

Take That Tom! Katie Holmes Embraces Therapy & Jamie Foxx To Get Revenge On Cruise Scientology opposes traditional psychotherapies.

Crafty Katie Holmes is throwing some backhanded shade on ex-husband Tom Cruise and Scientology, RadarOnline.com has learned, by parading her romance with Jamie Foxx and lauding psychological therapy — which the church disdains.

“Katie says therapy is the ONLY thing that saved her and daughter Suri from her suffocating marriage to Tom and the clutches of the church,” a source revealed to RadarOnline.com exclusively. “Now she wants to pass on the benefit of her experience to help other women who’ve weathered similar nightmares.”

Though Holmes, 38, escaped Cruise (and Scientology) in 2012, she’s determined to continue being an advocate of therapy. So it may be no surprise that her next role is in the adaptation of the best-selling self-help book “The Secret.”

“Katie hopes to use the film to become a self-help guru and completely defy Scientology’s views of therapy,” said the source.

The actress had refused offers to write an explosive tell-all about her stifling marriage to Tom and the iron fist of the church. But she’s finally gone public with the worst-kept secret relationship ever — her romance with Cruise’s longtime pal Foxx — and is now happy to show it off to the world.

“She loves the fact this will be the ultimate slap in Tom’s face!”

4,"Justin Theroux and Petra Collins Are Rumored To Be Dating It's only been about a month since Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston announced their separation, but The Leftovers star is already getting caught up in romance rumors—and they involve Selena Gomez's director BFF, Petra Collins. Daily Mail reports that the two have met up for dinner dates after meeting in the New York art scene, but Theroux insists they're just friends.

Neither have confirmed, let alone responded to, the dating gossip yet. But Theroux, 46, did previously share a photo with Collins, 25, last month on Instagram. (They also follow each other on the app.) Both wear Adam Selman graphic tees in the faceless post, and Collins is tagged.

Despite the suspicions, details on the two's relationship—platonic or not—remain clouded. However, fans are curious whether the rumored fling has any connection to the fact that Selena Gomez recently unfollowed Collins on Instagram, despite their close friendship. (Collins still follows Gomez, though.)

The pair first met in 2015, when Petra photographed Selena for Wonderland Magazine, and went on to become friends and creative collaborators. Collins directed Gomez's raunchy ""Fetish"" music video, which released last summer, and shot some of her promo photos. Last fall, they even talked about the possibility of writing a movie together. They were last seen in public together during New York Fashion Week last month, according to Elle.

Strangely enough, Theroux also gave a shoutout to Gomez on Instagram. In his first post after announcing his split from Aniston, the actor mentioned the singer in the hashtags: ""#selenagomez #Yeahthatsrightselenaididittoyouagainbutifyousawtheseguysyouddowhateveryoucouldtooalsoiknowyourechilllikethat.""

Theroux and Aniston announced their split on February 15, after getting married in August 2015. In a joint statement, the couple told the Associated Press that their separation was ""mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.""",0
5,"Murder of Jason Hudson Murder of Jason Hudson Location Chicago, Illinois Date October 24, 2008 ; 10 years ago ( )

8:00–9:00 (US Central time (UTC−06:00)) Target Julia Hudson Weapon SIG Sauer handgun Victim Jason Hudson

Darnell Donerson

Julian King Perpetrator William Balfour

The murder of 29-year-old Jason Hudson and his mother Darnell Donerson, occurred on October 24, 2008. They were discovered shot to death inside Donerson's home in Chicago, Illinois.[1] The victims were the brother and mother of singer Jennifer Hudson. Jennifer's seven-year-old nephew Julian King, the son of her elder sister Julia Hudson, was initially reported missing and an AMBER Alert was issued; Julian King's body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area, in a parked car matching the AMBER Alert description.[2] Autopsy results indicated that Julian King's death was due to ""multiple gunshot wounds.""[3] A pistol found in a West Side vacant lot was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police.[4]

Investigation [ edit ]

On the day that the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother were discovered, Chicago police took Julia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour, 27, into custody but did not file charges against him.[5] Balfour was on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking and possession of a stolen vehicle. The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered.[1]

After the Chicago police had held Balfour for the maximum 48 hours allowable without charging him with a crime, he was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation.[5] At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told by the Cook County State's Attorney's office that Balfour's current or former girlfriend told investigators she saw Balfour with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder occurred.[5] Board chairman Jorge Montes said that although Balfour may have violated other conditions of his parole, including failing to get anger management and substance abuse counseling, the gun allegation alone was sufficient to hold Balfour until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board.[5]

Montes said that the allegations from the woman included that Balfour had admitted to her that he was involved in the murders, but those allegations were not part of the parole review hearing.[6] Balfour appeared at the hearing without an assigned attorney because he had not been charged with a crime.[5]

Arrest and Conviction [ edit ]

On December 1, 2008, Balfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Donerson, Jason Hudson and King, as well as one count of felony home invasion.[7] At a December 3 court hearing in which Balfour was denied bail, a prosecutor alleged that Balfour had committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man.[8] Balfour's attorney Joshua Kutnick said that his client maintained his innocence in the crimes.[7] Balfour was indicted on December 30.[9] On January 20, 2009, he pleaded not guilty to all charges.[10] He was convicted in May, 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years.

Legacy [ edit ]

In the aftermath of the deaths, Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation ""to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to a violent crime,"" according to a statement released to the press.[11]",0

But she is also very much her own woman, as independent-spirited when it comes to fame and feminism as she has been in facing down Donald Trump.

Read highlights from the interview below:

On being in love:

""I've been deeply in love with everyone I've dated. Did you think I was faking it? I've always really embraced a duality. And really, truly, believed in it and never felt confused or struggling. I just didn't like getting made fun of.""

On dating men again:

""Yeah, totally. Definitely… Some people aren't like that. Some people know that they like grilled cheese and they'll eat it every day for the rest of their lives. I want to try everything. If I have grilled cheese once I'm like, 'That was cool, what's next?'""

On fame:

""Fame is valued quite ridiculously. So then there's this idea that you're beholden in some way, and I resent that. And it comes across like I'm ungrateful or something but, actually, I just find it weird to talk to the general public as a whole. Like, you can relate to a person, you can relate to an individual, but addressing the world at large is something that just perplexes me.""

On whether she suffers from 'Resting Bitch Face':

""Completely. I'm really not introverted - I'm just not acting all the time, which is what it would take to look like how people expect famous people to behave.""

""Men cannot say bitch anymore, I'm sorry. Say something different. Say, 'You're rude,' say, 'You're a dick,' whatever. Just to say, 'Oh that bitch.' You can't say that because there's nothing I could say to you, there's no retort that would be equal to that, therefore it's demeaning and literally on par with... something homophobic or something racist.""

On life as a woman in the United States, post Trump:

""It's obviously terrible what's happening but at the same time, it feels good to be part of a wider female community that is finally standing up for itself. I've never felt such a strong sense of community. So it's brought us together. The catalyst for this is regrettable, obviously, it's shitty. But at the same time I think that you need something to stir things up in order to get people to come together and define their opinions and force them to be heard.""

Kristen wears Chanel, photographed by Tom Craig

On her tomboy style:

She used to dress as ""a total tomboy"" and it was only at school that she realised it was ""not the most normal thing. Not all little girls are that way. And it actually really hurt my feelings, like badly. Like, I remember being in the sixth grade [aged 11] and [people would say] 'Kristen looks like a man. You're a boy', or whatever, and I was so offended, horrified and embarrassed. Now I look back on it and I'm like, 'Girl, be proud of that!'""

Everything shifted when Stewart hit puberty and grew her hair long. Suddenly she was accepted as one of the pretty girls ""and I was like, 'Fuck all of you!'""

8,"Kate and Leo: the 19-year friendship that's kept everyone guessing Leonardo DiCaprio enjoys meeting beautiful women on boats – anyone who has ever seen paparazzi photographs of the 41-year-old in his spare time could tell you that. But despite the endless run of supermodels, actresses and socialites who have latched on to his arm on various vessels over the years, only one (his mother aside), seems to have stayed the course. And she just so happens to have been the first, too.

Yesterday, as Sunday night’s action from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood was digested, social media melted with nostalgic pride at clips of Kate Winslet, DiCaprio’s original maritime fling, watching her old friend sate his two-decade hunger for an Academy Award, with his performance as a post-watershed Ray Mears in the 19th-century survival epic the Revenant.

There was Leo, trussed up in a dinner jacket and reciting his speech with all the calm and poise of a man who has had too much time to practise, when the camera deliberately cut to a tearful Kate (herself a nominee, losing to Alicia Vikander in the Best Supporting Actress category).

Eyes fixed on stage, hands clasped in prayer, rocking back and forth: in another context, Winslet might have looked more like a deranged racehorse owner – but this was the Oscars, so any melodrama is forgiven.

As the footage circulated online, the internet briefly averted its gaze from Donald Trump, and oohed and ahhed with glee.

“LEO AND KATE ARE SO CUTE,” one person calmly Tweeted. “They are the pinnacle of friendship goals,” another concluded. Thousands of similar messages followed. Forget the prizes, controversies, dresses and jokes the night threw up, for many viewers the highlight of the 88th Academy Awards was the enduring tale of a strictly platonic friendship forged 19 years ago, on the deck of the Titanic.

Of course, both actors’ careers could easily have easily sunk with James Cameron’s epic story of that ill-fated cruise liner. Neither DiCaprio nor Winslet was an established lead when they were cast as Jack and Rose, so when Cameron’s film ran both well over-budget and far beyond schedule, that lack of star power was just one of many reasons industry critics doubted its success.

More fool them: Titanic became the first movie to gross more than a billion dollars, and instantly made the pair (then only 21 and 22 respectively) two of the most bankable actors in the world.

Looking at images of them together on the red carpet at the 1998 Oscars, they could scarcely seem further from the slick, seasoned professionals of 2016. DiCaprio has the air of a 12-year-old wearing his father’s spare suit to a school ball; while Winslet, in dark lipstick and black lace, looks more 'tormented adolescent going through a Goth phase’ than Hollywood star.

Still, that early success set them on course for careers of impressively even stead: both became critically acclaimed as well as box office stars, and for a long time both were united in an inability to claim the biggest prize of all, despite regular awards nominations (including Golden Globe nods for Revolutionary Road in 2008, their first on-screen reunion since the mid-Atlantic).

Things didn’t stay quite so even in their personal lives - while Winslet married for the third time in 2012 (guess who walked her down the aisle?), DiCaprio continues his diligent quest to date every model on earth for at least an evening.

When Winslet eventually got her Oscar for The Reader in 2008, at her sixth time of trying, DiCaprio was there at the front, cheering loudly. Last night, as he achieved his own dream, she did the same. Little wonder the world should feel warmed.

Floating selfishly on that Titanic door (which Jack could easily have squeezed onto), all those years ago, Rose might have reneged on her promise to never let go, but in real life, the pair never drifted apart. And now they’ve finally been reunited in the Oscars hall of fame.",0
9,"Blac Chyna talks about Rob Kardashian's alleged revenge porn Blac Chyna is calling her ex Rob Kardashian a cyber bully and revenge porn perpetrator after he posted several nude photos of her on Instagram and Twitter.

Chyna, who was accompanied by her lawyer Lisa Bloom, told Lindsey Davis of ABC News that she is filing a temporary domestic violence restraining order to stop Kardashian from posting about her on social media in addition to keeping him physically away from her. ""Good Morning America"" aired a clip from the interview.

She said, ""I was devastated. Of course, I was like, how could somebody post these pictures of me? I'm like, wow, okay, this is a person I trusted. I just felt ... betrayed.""

Bloom said, ""Revenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong and form of domestic abuse.""

Chyna said she decided to take legal action after talking to Kardashian, who is the father of her daughter, Dream. She also alleged that he physically abused her in April.

""I talked to Rob about everything,"" she said. ""The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me. If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law.""

Chyna said she wants to inspire victims of revenge porn and cyber bullying to take action, and that it's irrelevant that she has posted racy photos of herself in the past.

""I'm Blac Chyna,"" she said. ""I can do whatever I want. It's my body.""

Chyna also shot down rumors that she got together with Kardashian in order to get revenge on her ex, Tyga, who left her to date Kardashian's half-sister, Kylie Jenner.

""That's not even my character,"" she said. ""I see all these things on the internet and I never address it because I'm a bigger person. Robert came at me."" She added that she was never trying to use the Kardashians for fame: ""I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardashians.""

Chyna said she has not heard from any of the Kardashians since Rob posted the photos. She addressed rumors circulating about her online spat with Kardashian, who claimed Chyna cheated on him during their relationship (Chyna said the two broke up in December). Kardashian wrote on social media that he was set off after Chyna sent him a video of herself kissing another man.

Chyna admitted to sending Kardashian the video, but said it was to get him off her back.

""Maybe if I send this video to him, he'll leave me alone,"" she said of her thought process. She added that she never ""liked"" any of the nude photos he posted of her, as rumored, and that she had him blocked on Instagram.

Though Chyna and Bloom are to file the restraining order on Monday, Chyna said she plans to keep joint custody of Dream with Kardashian.",0

12,"Blake Shelton ‘Disappointed’ Luke Bryan Joined ‘American Idol’ Over ‘The Voice’ Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan are competitors now that Luke is on ‘American Idol’ — and HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned that Blake is pretty disappointed about his pal’s decision.

“Blake [Shelton] has been hoping for more country artists to join the panel of coaches on The Voice,” an source close to the country star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He was actually a little jealous that American Idol got Luke [Bryan] because he was wishing that Luke would have joined The Voice one of these years. Blake isn’t going to lose sleep over it, but he definitely feels like Luke is an amazing get for the show and Idol did it right by getting him.” The American Idol re-boot had a lot of trouble locking down judges after convincing Katy Perry to commit, but at the last minute, they roped in Luke and Lionel Richie. The trio started filming auditions on Oct. 3.

Luke actually helped Blake out as a team advisor on season 12 of The Voice, but at that time, the season 13 coaches’ panel of Blake, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson had already been set. For season 14, Blake and Adam will return with Kelly Clarkson and a still-to-be-named fourth coach. So far on the show, there hasn’t been more than one country singer on the panel, so even though Blake was hoping for his pal to join, the possibility probably wasn’t very likely. Now, it looks like the bros will be going head to head in the ratings when both shows air next spring!

Blake has a great track record as a coach on The Voice, and has won the show a total of FIVE times. He has some stiff competition this season, and his fellow coaches are ALL out to take him down, so things should get good as things continue!

Kensington Palace announced Wednesday that the Givenchy bateau-neckline wedding dress worn by Meghan Markle for her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry will go on public display at Windsor Castle later this year. The Royal Collection Trust’s A Royal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex exhibit will also feature an identical version of the Household Cavalry frock-coat uniform worn by the groom on the couple’s big day.

The wedding outfits of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will go on display at Windsor Castle in 2018 and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh in 2019 in a special @RCT exhibition “A #RoyalWedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex”: https://t.co/j1N3WZFD50 pic.twitter.com/rKImNLva8w — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) August 29, 2018





When it comes to the Meghan’s dress, however, visitors to Windsor Castle — where the newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex wed — will see the actual dress designed for the royal bride by Givenchy’s Clare Waight Keller. Her embroidered veil and diamond-and-platinum tiara (a loaner from grandma-in-law Queen Elizabeth II) will also be on public display.

The exhibition gets underway on Oct. 28 and will run through Jan. 6, 2019. The wedding regalia will then move to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, from June 14-Oct. 6, 2019.

According to National Enquirer, the actor will feature in the reboot of the iconic horror franchise Dracula and to get into the skin of the character he plans to avoid the sun. Bale wants to make his skin as pale as possible to play the role of a Dracula.

""Christian is already fair-skinned, but he's been avoiding the California sun to get that unnatural skin tone like Dracula's,"" the magazine quoted a source as saying.

""This is a guy who will do anything to make the character look real to his audience and to himself. Everyone's praying he doesn't start drinking blood like a real vampire,"" the source said, adding, ""But no one would be surprised if he did take a swig of the stuff to make the scenes look real.""

However, Bale is not a part of the Dracula reboot movie neither he is planning to ""avoid sun"" for any of his Vampire related movies, Gossip Cop reported.

Meanwhile, on the work front, the actor is currently busy with an upcoming period drama Hostiles. The period drama, directed by Scott Cooper, is a period movie set in 1892 and is about a legendary Army captain who agrees to accompany a Cheyenne chief and his family.

16,"Meghan Markle In ‘Tears’ Over Scrutiny Of Her Royal Faux Pas: How Prince Harry Is Supporting Her God save Meghan Markle! The Duchess Of Sussex has run into some issues when it comes to her royal behavior, but she has her husband Prince Harry to support her through it!

Meghan Markle was just accused of breaking royal protocol and “disrespecting the Queen” when she crossed her legs at a royal engagement. Shortly after, she attempted to hold Prince Harry’s hand in public — which just isn’t what the royals do. Still, she’s only been a Duchess for a month and a half, so the Royal Family is cutting her some slack, even though she’s incredibly hard on herself. “Meghan does worry about messing up, she worries terribly, because she wants to do everything perfectly, so she really beats herself up when she gets even the tiniest thing wrong. But, there is so much to remember, so many minuscule little details, it’s kind of mind-blowing really–and all incredibly high pressured too, as it’s all under a microscope at the same time,” a palace insider told HollywoodLife.com exclusively.

“The funny thing is that the Queen is actually incredibly gracious to Meghan, she doesn’t put any pressure on her at all, it’s actually quite the opposite, and Harry is so loving and supportive, he’s constantly telling Meghan how amazing she’s doing, and how quickly she’s learning, and she is!” Aww! Listen, if the Queen doesn’t have a problem, we don’t have a problem.

At Meghan and Harry’s royal nuptials on May 18, the duchess seemed ready to commit to her role as a royal — singing God Save The Queen flawlessly, and crossing her legs at her ankles. Her few faux pas, while understandable to the royal family, are reportedly devastating to her. “The British press is constantly jumping on each and every little faux pas though, and publicly reprimanding Meghan, it’s horrible really, and some days she ends up in tears,” the insider revealed. “Harry is so protective of Meghan, and he hates how some of the newspapers write about her, it reminds him of his mother, and the way she was treated by the press, and sometimes Harry worries that nothing has really changed.” Recall, the British tabloids were incredibly tough on Princess Diana, but if Meghan is anything like her she’ll continue to handle herself with impeccable class!",0

Princess Charlotte’s recital?

National Enquirer this week reported that 2-year-old Princess Charlotte, the youngest and only daughter of Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton had randomly recited her grand ancestor, Queen Victoria’s quote. Queen Victoria had served as the Queen of England from 1837 to her death in 1901. The tabloid wrote that the little royal kid had shocked the palace staff members when she said what Queen Victoria used to say. Princess Charlotte was playing with a group of toddlers. After she finished playing, it seems that she looked at the royal helpers and said:

“The important thing is not what they think of me, but what I think of them.”

This quote was used by Queen Victoria in the 19th century.

Gossip Cop has spoken to a royal insider who laughed off at National Enquirer’s story. The insider also denied any such incident in the palace. The source revealed that the story of the tabloid was completely untrue. It is quite unlikely that a kid as small as Princess Charlotte could put together the words to make such a complete and articulate sentence. And then to repeat what was said almost a century ago is very far-fetched.

Is Princess Charlotte advanced for her age?

Last September, Princess Charlotte had accompanied her parents and brother to Canada. At a royal garden party, Princess Charlotte had mingled with other children and toddlers. Princess Charlotte moved around confidently round the garden lawn and engaged herself with the surroundings. She was just 16 years old when she went to Canada for this tour. But it was clearly seen that instead of the wobbly walk of any her age child, Princess Charlotte was walking quite sturdily and also was seen running at one point in time. She preferred balloons over bubbles. At her age, children usually can only mimic simple tasks. But Princess Charlotte was spotted trying to fold her cardigan which is quite a complex task for such a small child.

She seemed to have a good vocabulary at that age. Princess Charlotte was heard saying: dada, flower, and pop (for the balloons). Paul Kilshaw, 53, the children’s entertainer said:

“Charlotte asked for a flower, I think she said ‘flower’ because the other little girls were asking for flowers.”

She was not copying others like the other children of her age would but was inventing her own plays. She went and sat on the dog Moose. She also ran towards the balloons and started a game of her own of repeatedly hitting at them.

She also hugged the black and white rabbit around; which reveals her emotional development of passing on love to an animal. A spokesperson for the Royal family said:

“The Duke and Duchess are really pleased to have this opportunity to introduce their children to Canada and it’s great that they have the chance to play with other children while they are here.”

The show-stealer

Princess Charlotte is the show-stealer at most of the occasions. She seems to have inherited the dark Middleton eyes and her mother’s darker hairs. But she is gradually acquiring the royal genes. Her face now resembles that of her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II when she was small.

Prince William dots on his little one and calls her ‘the joy from the Heaven’. Friends say that the little Princess has a bubbly and confident character, but talking about her daughter, Princess Kate had said:

“She is very cute but she has got quite a feisty side. George has turned out to be a really lovely little boy. I hope George will keep Charlotte in order!”

Princess Charlotte was the bridesmaid for her maternal aunt, Pippa Middleton at the latter’s wedding on 20th May 2017 to financier James Matthews. Princess Charlotte looked cute in her tan-and-white dress by Pepa and Co. and had worn a floral headpiece. She was also holding a tiny basket and seemed quite fond of it. The mother-daughter duo made an amazing and beautiful pair!

The little Princess had also stolen the show at the Trooping the Colour Ceremony in June 2017 at the Royal Palace. She was in a pretty baby pink dress and stood on the balcony of the Buckingham Palace along with the other royal family members, enjoying the military specter.

The Princess’ life at Anmer Hall

For the last two years, Princess Charlotte had stayed with her parents and brother at Anmer Hall, her parents’ 10-bedroom mansion at Norfolk, England. It was a simple life there with Kate managing the whole show alone. She had her royal servants and her children’s nanny. An insider told People:

“There was no formality at all. It really was like any other family sitting down to lunch, with George and Charlotte eating their homemade food in their high chairs and toddling around with their toys.”

He added:

“You’d think that Kate and William would have an army of staff to help them out, but it really was just them and the children,”

20,"Charlie Sheen says he is HIV-positive (CNN) Actor Charlie Sheen told NBC's ""Today"" show Tuesday that he was diagnosed as HIV-positive about four years ago, and that a few people who knew it demanded money from him to keep the secret.

""I'm here to admit that I am in fact HIV-positive,"" Sheen told NBC's Matt Lauer. ""And I have to put a stop to this onslaught, this barrage of attacks and of sub-truths and very harmful and mercurial stories that are about the [alleged] threatening the health of so many others, which couldn't be farther from the truth.""

Sheen, 50, said he is not sure how he contracted the virus. Since his diagnosis, he said, he has informed every sexual partner of his condition. He called it ""impossible"" that he had transferred the virus to others.

He said the diagnosis came after he suffered a series of cluster headaches and night sweats.

""After a battery of tests ... they walked in the room and said, 'Boom, here's what's going on,'"" Sheen said.

""It's a hard three letters to absorb,"" he said. ""It's a turning point in one's life.""

Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Charlie Sheen has been in the public eye almost as long as the 50 years he's been alive. The actor, seen here in 2013, has appeared in dozens of films, headlined a hit TV show, battled substance abuse, dated porn stars and made numerous headlines for his bad-boy behavior. Here's a look at Sheen's turbulent life and career. Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years As the son of actor Martin Sheen, he had small parts in some of his father's films. The public may have first become aware of him as a thuggish visitor in a police station making conversation with Jennifer Grey in 1986's ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" That same year, Sheen starred in Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning film ""Platoon,"" playing Chris, a soldier in Vietnam caught in a battle between Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. Hide Caption 2 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen and Stone teamed up again in 1987 with ""Wall Street,"" in which Sheen played an up-and-coming broker seduced by Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko. Douglas' performance won an Oscar, and Sheen's own stock went up. Hide Caption 3 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen played relief pitcher Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn in the 1989 baseball comedy ""Major League."" The box office hit led to a 1994 sequel, ""Major League II,"" also featuring Sheen. Hide Caption 4 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years After becoming one of the hottest young actors of the '80s, Sheen saw his star dim in the '90s. Here he is in a poster for ""Men at Work,"" a minor comedy that starred him and brother Emilio Estevez as garbagemen who stumble on a nefarious plot. Hide Caption 5 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years ""Terminal Velocity,"" a 1994 film in which he played a skydiving instructor, fared even worse. Critics wondered whether the film was a goof, comparable to Sheen's ""Hot Shots!"" parody series. It made just $17 million at the box office on a $50 million budget. Hide Caption 6 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years By the mid-'90s, Sheen was as famous for being a ladies' man as he was for being a leading man. Known as ""the Machine,"" he dated porn stars, and though Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss kept the names of her clients secret, Sheen testified during her tax-evasion trial that he'd used her services. He also spent time in rehab and was hospitalized for a drug overdose . ""Pray for my boy,"" said his father. ""He has appetites that get him into trouble."" Hide Caption 7 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years But after a well-received turn in 1999's ""Being John Malkovich"" -- in which he played, well, Charlie Sheen -- Sheen was cast as Michael J. Fox's replacement in the hit ABC show ""Spin City."" Show creator Gary David Goldberg praised him. ""He's the first one on the set every morning and the last to leave at night,"" he said. The show ran until 2002. Hide Caption 8 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen rose to the top again with ""Two and a Half Man,"" playing free-spirited jingle writer Charlie Harper. The show was one of the highest-rated on television, and Sheen soon became the highest-paid actor on TV, eventually making close to $2 million an episode. But a rehab stint shut down production in 2010, and he and show creator Chuck Lorre were soon at loggerheads. Sheen was fired after the eighth season. Hide Caption 9 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen occasionally popped up in movies in the 2000s, though not of the level of his '80s work. Among them were ""Scary Movie 3,"" seen here with Denise Richards, ""Scary Movie 4"" and ""Scary Movie 5."" Hide Caption 10 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years In 2002, Sheen married Richards. The marriage produced two daughters but was rocky; Richards filed a restraining order against him in 2006 and filed for divorce while pregnant with their second child. Sheen later tried to block the appearance of their children on Richards' reality show and insulted her in the media, a habit he's continued to the present day Hide Caption 11 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen's third marriage, to actress Brooke Mueller, was also contentious. The two married in 2008 and divorced three years later, time that included Sheen's arrest on suspicion of domestic abuse and rehab stints for both. A custody battle ensued after the divorce, but the two are getting along for now. Hide Caption 12 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years The end of Sheen's marriage to Mueller and his firing from ""Two and a Half Men"" came in the midst of increasingly erratic behavior. He allegedly trashed a New York hotel room; he went on a radio show and criticized Lorre and Thomas Jefferson, among others; and he filed a lawsuit against Lorre and ""Two and a Half Men's"" studio, Warner Bros. Television. He joined Twitter and racked up a million followers in just over 24 hours -- a record, said Guinness . His tweets included the hashtags #winning and #tigerblood, both of which became catchphrases. He's shown here with publicist Stan Rosenfield, who resigned from that job in early 2011. Hide Caption 13 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years In April 2011, he embarked on tour of his one-man show, ""My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat Is Not an Option."" The first show, in Detroit, went off the rails quickly. ""Early in the evening, before the crowd turned sour, there was a creepy atmosphere that suggested group indoctrination into a cult,"" said a Hollywood Reporter review . And that was before the booing and shouts of ""You suck"" started. He changed the style to a Q&A for the second show, but the tour never really caught fire. Hide Caption 14 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Still, Sheen had enough buzz that he was announced as the lead in ""Anger Management,"" a TV version of the 2003 movie. The series lasted two years on FX. Meanwhile, ""Two and a Half Men"" ended its run in 2015 with Sheen's character -- who had been assumed dead -- crushed by a piano Hide Caption 15 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Since ""Anger,"" Sheen has had a guest spot on ""The Goldbergs"" and has popped up occasionally on TMZ . In November 2015 he announced to ""Today's"" Matt Lauer that he is HIV-positive. The actor said the diagnosis had inspired him to retire his hard-partying ways. ""It's a turning point in one's life,"" he said. Hide Caption 16 of 16

He said he revealed the diagnosis to people he thought he trusted, but some of them demanded money to keep the information to themselves. He paid those people ""in the millions,"" he said. Later in the show, Lauer said that Sheen told him it was more than $10 million.

""We're talking about shakedowns,"" Sheen said. ""I've paid those people.""

One of those people, he said, was a prostitute who entered his bathroom, took a cellphone picture of his medication and threatened to sell the image.

Asked if he would continue to pay the people he'd been paying, he said: ""Not after today, I'm not.""

'Charlie does not have AIDS'

Sheen was joined on the show by his doctor, Robert Huizenga, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at UCLA ,and was asked directly if he had AIDS.

""Charlie does not have AIDS,"" Huizenga said. ""AIDS is a condition where the HIV virus markedly suppresses the immune system and you are susceptible to rare, difficult cancers and infections. Charlie has none of those. He is healthy; he does not have AIDS.""

HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus , attacks the immune system by destroying white blood cells, which are vital to fighting infection. Once enough of these cells have been destroyed and the person has another ""opportunistic"" infection like pneumonia or tuberculosis, the diagnosis moves to the final stage of the infection, called AIDS.

There are two main ways HIV is spread in the United States -- by sex and by sharing needles, syringes or any of the equipment used to prepare and inject drugs. Anal sex carries the highest risk, followed by vaginal sex and having multiple partners.

In the ""Today"" interview, Sheen denied any possibility that he got the disease via drug use. ""No needles,"" Sheen said. He also said he was no longer on drugs, but did continue to drink and seek the company of prostitutes.

Photos: Photos: The PrEP Heroes campaign aims to increase awareness of drugs that prevent HIV from establishing itself if a person is exposed. ""Being a part of the PrEP Hero campaign was important because it was an opportunity to show diversity in communities where HIV and LGBT intersect,"" Franco De Marco said. Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: Models featured in the campaign all use the drug. ""As a community that's already dealt with hardship, hatred and discrimination, we don't need to turn on ourselves,"" Peter William Dunn said about breaking stigma around HIV and AIDS.

Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: Seth Fornea was inspired by PrEP Heroes to stage his own hero shoot to be part of the campaign.

""People who used the medication are stigmatized and stereotyped, rather than supported for taking steps to protect the health of themselves and their communities."" Hide Caption 9 of 9

In the past, Sheen has admitted to frequent visits to prostitutes at various times in his life. In July 1995, he testified in the tax evasion trial of ""Hollywood madam"" Heidi Fleiss that he had spent $53,000 in one 15-month period on ""sexual services.""

Two cases of 'unprotected sex'

Sheen told Lauer that he had unprotected sex ""under the care of my doctor"" with two women since his diagnosis, but that it was ""impossible"" that he had transferred the virus to them. While Huizenga did not agree that it's ""impossible,"" he did say it was highly unlikely.

""He was immediately put on treatment, strong antiviral drugs, which has suppressed the virus, to the point that he is absolutely healthy from that vantage,"" Huizenga said. ""Individuals who are optimally treated with undetectable viral loads, (the risk is) incredibly low to transmit the virus. We can't say it's zero, but it's an incredibly low number.""

Staying on daily medication is important to keep the HIV virus from developing resistance and spreading, experts said.

""Resistance occurs when the virus replicates in the presence of the drugs,"" said Dr. Stephen Boswell, president and CEO of Boston's Fenway Health, a healthcare organization that works with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. ""Missed dosages lead to lower concentrations in the bloodstream and in the body, so the virus can become resistant and spread. So staying on your medications and not missing dosages is absolutely critical.""

Sheen said that he was taking an antiviral ""cocktail"" of HIV drugs -- four pills per day -- and that he had not missed a day of medication, even while struggling with depression and substance abuse. Huizenga backed up his comment, saying that Sheen was undergoing lab tests every three to four months that showed the virus was at low levels.

""It's no longer a death sentence,"" Boswell said of HIV. ""It's a very different time now. Most people just diagnosed with HIV will live an almost normal life span if they get an early diagnosis, appropriate care and stay on their medications.""

Sheen was fired from ""Two and a Half Men"" in 2011 after a public meltdown that had the actor lashing out at the show's creator.

Among the more notorious points of his career, Sheen entered drug rehab twice and lived at one time with three women.

He's also been married multiple times and has children with ex-wives Brooke Mueller and Denise Richards. His ex-wives and an older child are aware of his illness, he said in the NBC interview.

A spokesman for Mueller told People magazine that she and her sons with Sheen, 6-year-old twins, do not have HIV.

Luckily for Brad and Jen, they have easy access to one of the most picturesque locations in the world.

'They are aiming for an August ceremony and reception at George Clooney's villa in Lake Como, Italy,' a source spills to In Touch.

Brad's longtime friend George, who let John Krasinski and Emily Blunt marry at his 18th-century estate in 2010, 'would be more than happy to host the nuptials.'

Unlike their 2000 wedding, which reportedly cost $1million, this second wedding joy will be 'smaller and more intimate,' according to friends.

Jen hopes to have a maximum of 14 guests, including George and wife Amal, best friend Courtney Cox and the six children Brad shares with estranged wife Angelina Jolie - Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 - for what an insider calls a 'classy, white-themed wedding.'

Brad's mother Jane will also reportedly be in attendance.

'Jane always loved Jen,' a friend told In Touch. 'So when Jane saw that there was an opening for Brad and Jen to find love again, she urged him to give it another shot.'

Now that Jen is back with Brad, the Hollywood starlet is happier than ever!

'This is the epic news that friends, family and fans have been hoping for since their split in 2005,' a source tells the US publication. 'Forget about the royal wedding - this is the wedding of the century.'

Did or did not Amal Clooney ban George Clooney from their bedroom because she is tired of his constant company after the birth of their twins? This is the strange and also the incredibly absurd claim that popped up in one of this week’s new tabloids.

Gossip Cop was the one that looked into this situation and let everyone know what they have exclusively found out.

Venice ? A post shared by Amal Clooney (@amalclooney) on Sep 3, 2017 at 8:52am PDT

The latest issue of Star magazine includes an article which says that the actor has been doting on his wife and twins since their birth. The twins are Alexander and Ella, and they were born back in June.

According to Star’s questionable report, the human rights attorney has been somehow put off by her husband’s devotion to their family.

A so-called insider told the same magazine that Amal secretly hopes that the actor will go back to work as soon as possible.

The same source added that ‘George thinks he’s helping but he’s really just making more work for Amal. Sometimes she jokes it’s like having three kids!’

Star’s dubious insider continues, ‘George isn’t coping well with the lack of sleep. So Amal has kindly suggested that he sleep in the guest room so she can get some rest.’

The magazine’s assertion that Amal would be irritated with George being a caring father and husband is, of course, completely bogus and absurd as well.

Gossip Cop even checked with a reliable source, and the magazine’s reports turned out to be ridiculous as they don’t even make sense at all.

George recently said that parenting is not an easy thing to do, and he discussed splitting the job with his wife. Recently, he even took a break from parenting and went to have a bit of fun with a friend.

Mike Tyson Offered SERIOUS Ca$h To Fight Russian Dictator Vladimir Putin Will the former pro-boxer punch the president’s lights out for money?

In the fight of the century, former pro-boxer Mike Tyson may be getting into the rink with Russian President Vladimir Putin, RadarOnline.com has learned.

Sources have confessed to Straight Shuter that very wealthy businessmen have offered the 51-year-old pro boxer over $500K to travel to Russia and have a boxing match with the 64-year-old President.

He has also been offered a small fortune to do a convention in New York City, backed of course, by the Russians.

Investors have even offered to fly him to the powerful country and translate his book into Russian if he accepts to participate in the fight.

As Radar readers know, Putin has recently been busted for having a bizarre Hollywood the list filled with dirty secretes on Tinseltown’s biggest stars – all of which he is reportedly prepared to expose if they crusade against Russian outrages.

The award-winning boxer has yet to comment on the matter of the fight.

24,"VIDEO: 'Homecoming' Teaser: Julia Roberts Is Ready to 'Get Started' “Shall we get started?”

Amazon revealed the first teaser trailer for “Homecoming,” its upcoming psychological starring Julia Roberts, during the Prime Video panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2018 on Friday. And though it only gives us a tiny glimpse of Roberts in character as caseworker Heidi Bergman (she literally just scribbles down some notes, says the above line to someone off camera and then clicks on a tape recorder) we’re already entranced by her calm, collected mannerisms. Luckily, Amazon also revealed that you won’t have to wait much longer, as “Homecoming” will premiere this November on the streaming service.

The rest of the one-minute clip promoting the mind-bending drama directed by “Mr. Robot” creator Sam Esmail, explores the abandoned halls of what we can safely assume is the titular Homecoming Transitional Support Center where Heidi workers, a Geist Group facility helping soldiers transition back to civilian life.

Walter Cruz (Stephan James) is one of these soldiers, eager to begin the next phase of his life. Overseeing Heidi and the facility is Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an ambitious company man whose manic demands point to questionable motives.

Four years later, Heidi has started a new life, living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and working as a small-town waitress, when a Department of Defense auditor (Shea Whigham) comes to her with questions about why she left the Homecoming facility. Heidi begins to realize that there’s a whole other story behind the story she’s been telling herself.

Based on the popular podcast of the same name, “Homecoming” is created by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg. Along with Roberts, the cast includes Jeremy Allen White, Alex Karpovsky and Dermot Mulroney, among others.

Mulroney is set for a recurring guest star role as Anthony, Heidi’s (Roberts) boyfriend, who is eager to please, but a bit needy and grows increasingly frustrated with Heidi’s lack of attention to him and their relationship.

“Homecoming” is produced by Esmail through his production company Esmail Corp; as well as “Mr. Robot” executive producer Chad Hamilton of Anonymous Content; the podcast’s Horowitz and Bloomberg; and Chris Giliberti, Alex Blumberg, and Matt Lieber of Gimlet Media. Roberts will also serve as executive producer through her production company Red Om Films; her partners Lisa Gillan and Marisa Yeres Gill will co-executive produce.

26,"Kim Cattrall says Sex and the City stars are toxic Kim Cattrall has given just a handful of sit-down interviews in the two decades since 'Sex and the City' first premiered on HBO, with the actress having long been fiercely protective of her private and professional relationships.

That all changed on Monday night however, when Cattrall took a seat opposite Piers Morgan for a taping of the ITV series 'Life Stories.'

The 61-year-old actress was appearing on the program just days after multiple sources told DailyMailTV that he outrageous demands had led to Warner Bros. cancelling plans for a third 'Sex and the City' film, a claim she flat out denied.

Cattrall then used the interview to open up about Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Davis for the first time, call her relationship with the women 'toxic.'

And in a move that would no doubt leave her publicist character Samantha Jones reeling, Cattrall went on to say that the only thing she ever had in common with her on-screen pals was the fact that they all starred in the critically-acclaimed and publicly-adored series.

Scroll down for video

Story time: Kim Cattrall sat down with Piers Morgan (above) for an interview on Monday night that will air on the ITV series 'Life Stories'

Too high, can't come down: Cattrall said her relationship with the three women she co-starred with on 'Sex and the City' was 'toxic' (l to r: Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis in 2010)

Losin' my head: 'The common ground that we had was the series and the series is over,' said Cattrall (Parker and Davis in 2015 on left, Nixon and Parker in 2017 on right)

Spinnin' round and round: Davis shared a snap of herself and Nixon last month in front of a 'Sex and the City' sketch (above)

Cattrall told Morgan on Monday that having a relationship with the other women was difficult on account of the fact she leads a very different life and has different priorities than her co-stars.

'They all have children and I am ten years older and since specifically the series ended I have been spending most of my time outside of New York so I don't see them,' said Cattrall.

'The common ground that we had was the series and the series is over.'

Cattrall went on to note: 'I've moved on, this is what my sixties are about, they're about me making decisions for me not my career, for me. And that feels frickin fantastic.'

She quickly added: 'But everything comes to an end and in closing one door another door opens and that door has been waiting for a long time.'

Parker is 52 and has been married to actor Matthew Broderick for 20 years, with whom she has three children: teenager son James and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha, 8, who were born via surrogate.

Nixon is 51 and has been married to wife Christine Marinoni for five years.

The education activist gave birth to the couple's son Max in 2011, and Nixon has a son Charles,14, and daughter Samantha, 21, from her previous relationship with partner Danny Mozes.

Davis is 52 and in 2011 adopted her daughter Gemma. She ad Cattrall are both single, though Davis has never before been married while her older co-star has twice walked down the aisle.

Chain gang: Parker is 52 and has been married to actor Matthew Broderick for 20 years, with whom she has three children: teenager son James and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha, 8 (above in April)

Modern family: Nixon is 51 and has been married to wife Christine Marinoni for five years (couple above in 2008)

Family matters: Davis is 52 and in 2011 adopted her daughter Gemma (above in May)

Cattrall told Morgan that she had no idea when she last spoke to her co-stars, and that no one was reaching out when the reports began circulating about her holding up the film.

'And that's another thing that's really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, 'how you doing?' That would have been the way to handle it,' said Cattrall.

'And usually what happens in a healthy relationship is that someone, or a transaction for a job in my business, is that someone says, 'are you available?' and you say 'yes' and here's the job and you say 'yes but thank you very much but I'm sort of over here right now but thank you very much' and that person turns to you and they say 'that's great, good luck to you, I wish you the best.' '

Cattrall then noted: 'That's not what happened here, this is, it feels like a toxic relationship.'

Over it: 'This is, it feels like a toxic relationship,' said Cattrall (above in May)

She also said that she would not rule out a reconciliation with Parker.

'There is genuine affection and there has been over the years,' said Cattrall.

'This is extenuating circumstances and in the past I've felt, wow, especially with the fans I don't want to in any shape or form ruin an ideal of it, because it does stand for empowerment and it does stand for women sticking up for each other, but not always.'

Cattrall did confirm to Morgan though that Samantha Jones would never again be back on screen.

'Me playing her, that I can assure you will never happen. For me it's over, it's over with no regrets, I just wish that Sarah had been nicer,' said Cattrall.

'I'm at a point in my life where I am making decisions that make me happy and going backwards in life doesn't make me happy. Going forward that's how I feel, I'm on the front foot not my backfoot.'

Cattrall also scoffed at the notion that she was ever close to signing on to the film, telling Morgan that she declined an offer to return as sex-positive publicist Samantha Jones.

'The answer was always no and a respectful, firm, no,' said Cattrall.

She then addressed some of the specific allegations reported by DailyMailTV claiming: 'I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects, to be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.'

Firing back: 'That's another thing that's really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, ""how you doing?""' said Cattrall (Davis, Parker and Nixon above in 2002)

Adios: 'I'm at a point in my life where I am making decisions that make me happy and going backwards in life doesn't make me happy,' said Cattrall (her costars on left in 2004 and right in 2010)

Heading to the bank: The women have certainly been valuable players to the studio. The first 'Sex and the City' film was made for $65 million and grossed $415 million worldwide while the sequel (above) brought in $300 million on a $100 million budget

The exact demands that Cattrall made were not revealed by sources, but she has certainly been a valuable player to the studio.

The first 'Sex and the City' film was made for $65 million and grossed $415 million worldwide while the sequel brought in $300 million on a $100 million budget.

Both of those films were two of the biggest profit generators for the studio that year.

Cattrall also spoke about her perceived reputation as a diva, an allegation that has circled her for years despite the fact that she avoids the limelight.

'The inference is from some unknown source, the inference is, is that I am a diva, that I've held up production in some way that, 'oh now we don't get to make our movie because of you,'' said Cattrall.

'I want them to make the movie, if that's what they want to do. It's a great part. I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it, maybe they could make it an African American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones?'

Cattrall then offered up more ideas for a third installment.

'Or bring in another character. It can be another character. This is what I really believe that this franchise needs another point of view and this could be it,' said Cattrall.

'I don't feel like a victim, I feel like I came out of this on top. This has given me a fantastic platform. Sarah Jessica, she could have been nicer, she could have in some way. I don't know what her issue is, I never have.'",0
27,"Taylor Swift & Joe Alwyn: Why He Didn’t Join Her At Billboard Awards & They Are Both ‘Happier’ For It Taylor Swift went solo for her surprise appearance at the Billboard Music Awards on May 20 and she had very good reason to do so. Find out why she didn’t bring her love, Joe Alwyn, here!

Taylor Swift, 28, surprised everyone when she showed up to the Billboard Music Awards on May 20 and although she seems happier than ever with boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, 27, she’s happy she attended the event alone. It turns out Joe is busy making a name for himself in his acting career and Tay is in full support of her hunky beau. “Joe is determined to make it as an actor in his own right, and not to be known just as Taylor Swift’s boyfriend,” a source close to Joe EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Taylor is really supportive of Joe’s career, and totally understands why he doesn’t want to be a red carpet fixture with her. Joe has been in Cannes where he was awarded the Chopard Trophy, which is a huge honor and recognizes Joe as one of the hottest up and coming actors of his generation. Taylor loves that Joe is so dedicated to his career, and to making it big in his own name, and their relationship is all the happier for it.”

Despite the constant spotlight on Taylor, Joe isn’t letting it bother him and in fact, he’s giving her equal support too. “It can be really challenging to date Taylor, as she’s such a huge star, but Joe isn’t phased by it in the slightest—he is very secure in himself, and determined to succeed on his own terms—it’s one of the things Taylor loves the most about him, and why their relationship is one of the healthiest she has ever had,” the source continued.

We’re so happy to hear that things are going well for these two and it’s good to know Taylor can stand on her own and be confident with or without her boyfriend by her side! With the criticism she’s received about having too many boyfriends in the past, it’s great to see her embracing her independence while being in love at the same time. You go, girl!",0

The actress still breaks down in tears thinking about her ex Brad Pitt having more custody of them in the future, we’ve EXCLUSIVELY learned. Find out why!

Brad Pitt, 53, and Angelina Jolie, 42, are reportedly in a better place with each other in the wake of their Sept. 2016 split. Even so, she’s still coming to terms with the reality of not having her children around all the time — given how things can change with their custody agreement. “Angelina’s not at all comfortable with the idea of being separated from her kids, just talking about it can make her cry,” a source close to the By The Sea actress tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “It’s hard for her to imagine Brad taking them all overseas without her, she would not like it if the shoe was on the other foot. There’s a huge double standard but she doesn’t see it that way.”

Brad has been spending as much time as possible repairing his relationship with their precious kids Maddox, 15; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh, 11; and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. Luckily, Angelina reportedly moved into an epic abode just two miles away from Brad’s home, which gives him the opportunity to see his kids more often. The family, sans Brad, was spotted jetting out of LAX for Father’s Day and they were all smiles while together.

As we previously reported, “He’s not complaining, but he had planned to spend some time with them for Father’s Day,” a source close to Brad told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He was working on his place to make it special for them, adding a new skateboard ramp. He saw Angie’s 100 foot water slide and wanted to make his place special for them as well. Although their relationship has improved, communication is a struggle at times.”

To get their family back on track, Brad’s taking extra measures. “The kids don’t love therapy, but they know that Brad has to do it,” an OK! magazine insider claims. “[Therapy’s] allowed them to get a better sense of his issues and come to terms with what went wrong in their parents’ marriage. Brad has firmly but gently explained that no matter how much he loves their mother, they are not getting back together. He doesn’t want them to have false hopes.”

30,"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Is a Master Class in PR Spins There have been plenty of celebrity breakups recently, but none have been so carefully analyzed as the Pitt-Jolie separation. Each bit of information that reaches the media is being treated like a chess move in a big game of Who Gets to Keep Their Reputation.

Angelina Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged altercation between Brad Pitt and their son Maddox on a private plane. The only info that we, the reading public had at first was that she cited irreconcilable differences, and was trying to get sole custody of their children. Wanting sole custody seemed significant, even before reports of Pitt’s drinking began to surface.

Now that Marion Cotillard has denied any involvement in the separation, the media focus is more and more on how Pitt interacts with his children. Is he a man who drinks and emotionally or physically abuses his family when intoxicated? Or is Angelina Jolie exaggerating one family argument so she can get custody, then jet off to the U.N., as the Pitt camp alleges? It all kind of hinges on some recorded evidence of the inciting incident that supposedly led to Jolie’s filing.

Lainey Gossip devoted a long blog Friday to the way in which Brad Pitt has been trying to set up the video of his argument with Jolie and Maddox, a video that has not yet been released, but likely will judging from the way Pitt’s PR is trying to lay the groundwork. She points out that Pitt’s team has clearly chosen People as their tabloid of choice, and in a post literally titled “Brad’s Side of the Story” they have carefully crafted how we should read the abuse allegations. As Lainey writes:

You know what’s interesting though? PEOPLE’s version of “Brad’s side of the story” has been amended. The one that’s up on the site right now has been edited. Originally when they posted the article last night, this is how it read: The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. “He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was nose to nose and was spiraling out of control.” You see the difference? The detail about Brad and presumably Maddox going “nose to nose”? Also this sentence has been removed from the paragraph that now ends with “attempts to gain custody”: The Pitt source adds that the star “was not black-out drunk” and that “he absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.” Brad’s team doesn’t want you visualising him going “nose to nose” with his 15 year old son. And they certainly don’t want you suspecting that he may have been “black-out drunk”. Just, you know, regular drunk. But drunk enough that Brad’s people can’t straight up deny it. And drunk enough and angry enough that his people cannot categorically dismiss the reports that there was all kinds of drama on that plane.

It seems like this video will be seen by the public, either through a “leak” or the divorce proceedings, and both sides are prepping public perceptions for how it should be received.

Taylor and Joe allegedly first met at the 2016 Met Gala, but their ~relationship status~ wasn't confirmed until a year later in May 2017. A source tells People, ""Joe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She’s in a very good place.""

On the few occasions they have been spotted together in public, the couple have always looked like they're absolutely crazy about each other, but have made sure to hide their love from the public eye as much as possible. In fact, these photos mark the first time Taylor and Joe have been spotted together since their lunch date in North London over a month ago. In other words then, this is a far cry from those seemingly-posed, definitely cheesy beach pics with her (also British) ex Tom Hiddleston.

Well the two certainly look like they're having a lovely time on their little beach getaway, soaking in some sun and snorkeling and hopefully enjoying colorful cocktails too. But a gigantic Taymerica inflatable pool slide would've made it even better, right?! Then again, as we see in the photo, who needs a floatie when you've got a... dreamboat to lean on?

For the dinner date, Foxx wore skinny white pants and a navy blue polo. Holmes, meanwhile, kept cool from the summer heat in a Zimmermann two-piece look. The outfit featured high-waisted, pleated shorts with a semicircle trim and a cropped, off-shoulder bodice top.

The 39-year-old Dawson’s Creek alum paired the ensemble with a red handbag, tan shoes, a pendant necklace, and oversized sunglasses.

Shelton and Bauer have settled the lawsuit that the country singer and “The Voice” coach filed against the publisher, according to court papers obtained by TheWrap.

A stipulation for dismissal filed in federal court in California on Thursday notes that all parties have agreed to dismiss the suit with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be filed again later.

While the terms of the settlement were not disclosed, the stipulation notes that each party will be responsible for its own costs and attorneys’ fees.

Shelton filed suit against Bauer Publishing Company and Bauer Media Group in October 2015 over two articles that In Touch published, claiming that Shelton had cheated on his former wife, Miranda Lambert, and that he was heading to rehab after hitting “rock bottom.”

“Blake Shelton has had enough,” the lawsuit read.

Shelton’s complaint noted that the singer was prepared to let the first story, that he cheated on Lambert go, but then the rehab story was published.

“Mr. Shelton is not in rehab and has no plans to go to rehab, which Bauer would have known had it bothered to contact any of Mr. Shelton’s representatives prior to publication of its misleading Rehab Story,” the lawsuit read.

Alleging libel per se and false light invasion of privacy, Shelton’s lawsuit sought damages “not to be less than” $2 million.

37,"Is Kylie Jenner Pregnant Again With Baby #2? New Rumors She's Expecting Again With Travis Scott Stormi may have a sibling on the way.

Is Kylie Jenner pregnant again with baby #2? Already? Rumors say yes. There's been rampant speculation that the reality star And Forbes' youngest almost-billionaire and her beau Travis Scott are expecting a second child. Even though its only been a few months since Kylie and Travis' first daughter, Stormi, was born it's very possible that she could be pregnant.

We, of course, may not know for awhile as she didn't officially confirm her last pregnancy until three days after she gave birth.

Here is what we know so far about the Kylie pregnancy rumors:

1. A source said they were trying for another baby while on vacation.

A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 11:12am PDT

Kylie and Travis went on vacation to Turks and Caicos to celebrate Travis' birthday. While there, they were reportedly doing more than just celebrating. ""Kylie and Travis have been having amazing baby-making sex while on vacation. Travis is totally turned on by Kylie now that she has bounced back from her pregnancy and has all of her insane curves again. Travis finds Kylie irresistible in her bikini and thinks she looks amazing,"" a source said.

2. Kylie wants Stormi to have a sibling close in age.

A post shared by Kendall + Kylie (@kendallandkylie) on Jul 17, 2018 at 7:17pm PDT

The new mom wants her daughter to have a sibling close in age like her and Kendall. ""Kylie wants her kids to be close in age like she is with Kendall. So they can grow up being best friends."" Kendall is two years older than Kylie so they still have a bit more time.

3. Kylie loves seeing Travis be a dad.

A post shared by Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott (@kyandtravis) on Jul 17, 2018 at 10:45am PDT

A source said, ""Nothing has been sexier to Kylie than to watch Travis become an amazing father to their daughter. Things between them have never been better.""

4. Kylie had a pregnancy scare.

A month ago, Kylie reportedly had a pregnancy scare. A source close to Kylie told Hollywood Life the scare ""really freaked her out,"" but that ""Travis was super excited to have another kid right away. [Kylie] was totally upset over the idea of being pregnant again so quickly. She has been so relieved to get her body back after the last year, so she is not ready to go through it all again so soon after giving birth to Stormi,"" the source explains. ""Kylie thought that it must be some miracle for her to get pregnant again so soon after giving birth, but quickly realized it was only a false alarm.""

5. She's gotten pregnant quickly before.

Just one month into her relationship with Travis Scott the young mogul found out she was expecting. She says this was because their relationship felt so natural and drama-free from the public eye. ""We had a lot of downtime. It was organic. And we would just go to these random cities. We got to not be who we really were. Like, if we were in LA, I feel like it would’ve been way different. Everything happened for a reason. We weren’t going out as ‘Kylie and Trav.’ We would just be in Cleveland, walking the street for hours. We would go on walks, and no one would bother us,"" Kyile said.

6. She said she had the 'perfect' experience with her first pregnancy.

A post shared by Stormi Jenner Webster (@stormijenner.w) on Jul 17, 2018 at 7:57pm PDT

When asked what the worst part of her pregnancy was she had a surprising answer. “There really was no worst part! probably not being able to eat sushi lol,” the makeup mogul revealed. “I had such a perfect experience.” Sounds like she wouldn't mind being pregnant again.

7. Travis and Kylie like to keep things private.

A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 7, 2018 at 9:55pm PDT

Kylie has said, ""For sure, I know he [Travis] doesn't like the attention. That's why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won't come. Because I want him to do his own thing. I want him to be him. I don't want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don't ever see us together, that's okay with me, because we just do our thing."" So if she is, indeed, pregnant, we probably won't know until she's totally ready to share.

39,"Justin Bieber Desperate To Show Selena Gomez’s Mom He’s Changed — How He Plans To Prove It As Selena Gomez and her mom remain estranged over Sel’s relationship with Justin Bieber, the Biebs has a plan in play to get back in Mandy Teefey’s good graces!

Selena Gomez and Mandy Teefey have some issues to work out in their mother/daughter relationship, and their recent feud all began when the 25-year-old reconciled with on-off love, Justin Bieber. Now, it’s in Justin’s court to prove to Mandy that he’s a changed man from all those times he broke Selena’s heart…and his plan to do so is already underway! The Biebs is currently on vacation with his own mom, Patti Mallette, which he hopes will “demonstrate to Mandy how important family is to him,” HollywoodLife has EXCLUSIVELY learned.

Justin and Patti have drifted apart in their own right over the years, but are bonding in “paradise” on their trip. “It serves as a display of what he’s hoping Selena can achieve with her mother someday,” our inside says. “He feels terrible for Selena that her mother won’t accept him, and sympathizes with her and what she’s dealing with. Justin wants to show Mandy that he has matured immensely, and that he can be to Selena what she is to him — his rock and support. Justin truly hopes Selena and Mandy can form a great bond just like he now has with his own mom.”

Selena hasn’t commented on the ongoing drama she’s having with her mom. Meanwhile, it’s been quite a bit of time since we’ve actually seen Justin and Selena together. They were in Mexico for New Year’s Eve, then returned to California together and were spotted at a pilates class on Jan. 3. After that, though, they went their separate ways — she spent time in Texas and New York, while he took a ski trip, spent a few days in Dubai, and then headed to the Maldives with Patti. When will they reunite!!?

HollywoodLifers, do you think Justin will be able to prove to Mandy that he’s changed?",0

Nine years ago on Wednesday, the couple tied the knot. And in celebration of their anniversary, DeGeneres, 59, shared a loving tribute to Instagram!

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

“@PortiadeRossi and I got married 9 years ago today,” the Ellen DeGeneres Show host captioned a smiling, black-and-white photo of the pair on their wedding day. “Being her wife is the greatest thing I am.”

Singer Joshua Radin, who performed at the couple’s wedding, also took to the photo and video-sharing app to celebrate their union.

“Nine years ago today, these two incredible women got married and asked me to sing some of my songs to them while they were celebrating their most special day. It’s still one of the most fun things I’ve ever done,” Radin wrote. “Happy anniversary @theellenshow and @portiaderossi.”

During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, de Rossi recalled about falling for DeGeneres. “We actually met socially and I just felt that immediate draw,” she said. “We did talk a little bit and then over those three years, we saw each other at parties or at various things, but the one time that was the most significant was during a photoshoot actually.”

She continued: “I just walked over to say hello to her, and I couldn’t believe it, but she turned around and it was like an arrow was shot through my heart. I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it.”

In a 2008 episode of her talk show, DeGeneres announced her plans to wed de Rossi; the reveal followed the news that the California Supreme Court had struck down a law banning same-sex marriage. The happy couple later showed off their engagement bling on the Daytime Emmys red carpet that same year.

That August, the couple tied the knot with an intimate ceremony in their L.A. home. (To see more of their cute moments from throughout the years, click here).

“Portia and I constantly say to each other, ‘We are so lucky.’ Sometimes it’s lying in bed at night before I go to sleep, and I just say thank you to whatever, whoever is out there,” DeGeneres told PEOPLE in her 2016 cover story. “I’ve gotten to a place where I really am just settled. Really. I know that I’m not going anywhere. She’s not going anywhere. I’m not saying the relationship took a while; I’m saying in my life, it took a while to find this.”",0
41,"Robert Pattinson And Kristen Stewart Are Not Getting Back Together “Twilight” fans have been eagerly awaiting for the day that stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart would get back together following their high profile break up. Despite a new article alleging the former co-stars are rekindling their romance, it looks like Robsten shippers will have to keep on dreaming, seeing as sources shut down the report as false.

Pattinson and Stewart began dating in 2009 after meeting on the set of the supernatural movie. The former couple experienced a brief break up in 2012 when the actress was caught cheating with her “Snow White and the Huntsman” director Rupert Sanders. Although the actors tried to work past the scandal, their relationship officially ended in 2013.

A new report published by OK! claims Stewart is “on the rocks” with her current girlfriend, Stella Maxwell, and has been spending time with her ex-boyfriend.

“Kristen is angling to give things between them another go. She’s hoping that Rob is serious when he says he’s forgiven what happened back then,” an “insider” told the tabloid.

The OK! “insider” went on to claim there is still a spark between the former couple and their friends are beginning to question if they will get back together. “They’re trying to keep it low-key, but there’s still chemistry there. People in their circles are starting to wonder if they’re considering a reconciliation.”

However, a source told Gossip Cop the article is nonsense and revealed Stewart and Pattinson are not considering a reconciliation.

Following Pattinson and Stewart’s split, the stars moved on to other people. The actor began dating British singer FKA Twigs in 2014. The two were briefly engaged before news of their break up began to surface in 2017.

Towards the end of that year, Pattinson was accompanied by a mystery woman to Seth MacFarlane’s annual holiday party. At the time, sources told Us Weekly the two didn’t attempt to hide they were together and held hands throughout the night.

Meanwhile, Stewart has been in a relationship with Maxwell since December 2016. The two were most recently photographed enjoying a cozy date night on March 21 in Los Angeles.

While fans of Pattinson and Stewart are still hoping the pair will get back together, it looks like the exes have their sights set on other people.

42,"Did Miley Cyrus get mad at Liam Hemsworth for refusing to wear his promise ring? Miley Cyrus’ new album, Younger Now, is set to release next month. So far we have three songs and I’m not in love with any of them. I’m meh on Younger Now but I find Malibu and Inspired practically unlistenable. There’s a few left to release, though, including Rainbowland featuring her godmother, Dolly Parton. I’m sure one of them will appeal to me.

Anyway, with all this new music coming out, people are once again wondering if Miley and fiancé Liam Hemsworth will ever walk down the aisle. I maintain that the speculation is as much the couple’s doing as the press. I think Miley likes us talking about her and she knows this is one thing fans will never tired of. However, if Life & Style is to be believed, it goes much deeper than that. L&S claims that Miley pitched a major fit over Liam not wearing his promise ring and the fight grew loud before she gave him the silent treatment for almost two days.

When Miley Cyrus channeled her inner Beyoncé and put a ring on longtime boyfriend Liam Hemsworth, it was supposed to be a sign of their commitment to each other. There was just one small problem: the Australian actor refused to wear it. That did not sit well with Miley, 24, and sources reveal exclusively to Life & Style that the piece of jewelry became the subject of a nasty shouting match. “She pushed him and pushed him to wear the ring,” the insider says, “and she finally lost her temper and was screaming at him furiously. The fight was one of the worst they’ve ever had.” The former Disney star was so mad she actually threw her phone to the ground and smashed it. “She refused to talk to him for almost two days after that,” the source adds. Liam, 27, has since apologized and agreed to wear the promise ring. He was recently spotted out with the hardware on that finger, prompting wedding rumors. However, the couple is not walking down the aisle anytime soon. Miley and Liam, who have been engaged on and off since 2012, both agree the fight has strengthened their relationship. “Things have turned around lately,” the source tells Life & Style. “Miley and Liam are so much happier now.”

[From Life & Style]

Wait a minute – these two are engaged so this is an engagement ring, isn’t it? If you need a promise ring when you’re engaged, you have bigger issues. But it definitely sounds like they have issues if Miley is smashing phones. The question is, of course, did this happen? I don’t know, I’m inclined to think it might have. Not that the fight was solely over the ring but the ring was the last straw and Miley snapped. I get it, she’s under a lot of pressure. I haven’t heard the songs yet but the titles are all about love and coupledom – if Malibu is any indication, this album is one giant love note to Liam. And given Liam’s track record, I guess I can understand why she needs a symbolic gesture. If it is true, I’m glad Liam made the effort by finally wearing the ring.

Unfortunately, Liam’s lack of ring is not all Miley has to deal with. She is among those to have intimate photos stolen in the latest hacking scandal. Oh, how I hate these creeps, I hope they get what’s coming to them. I’m not going to give them any more space so that’s all I will say about that. On a nicer note, Miley bought a ranch in Nashville and I am positively emerald with envy. You can see pictures here, it’s just gorgeous. It would also be a beautiful setting for a wedding. Hmmmm.

43,"Tom Hiddleston Is Such a Lock for James Bond That You Can’t Bet on It Anymore However much Tom Hiddleston might be denying that his turn in the updated espionage thriller The Night Manager was his way of auditioning to be the next James Bond, it certainly seems fans are having none of it. Coral bookmakers in the U.K. had to suspend betting on the actor, The Guardian reports, after a huge bet launched the actor’s perceived chances from 2-1 to 1-2. Similarly, the Ireland-based independent bookmaker BoyleSports announced Sunday in a press release that they’d also been forced to suspend betting after Hiddleston’s support skyrocketed. It seems, regardless of what anyone claims, the world is really trying to will this casting decision into existence—and really, who can blame anyone for trying?

According to BoyleSports’s release, Hiddleston was the 6-4 favorite for them before the whirlwind of bets—including one four-figure online bet from the U.K. Hiddleston was his nearest rival at 5-2, followed by Idris Elba and Damian Lewis, who were tied at 5-1.

“Judging by the gamble on Tom Hiddleston we expect that it’s only a matter of days before he is announced as Daniel Craig’s replacement,” BoyleSports representative Liam Glynn said in the press release. That might be a little hyperbolic, and lacking in knowledge of how Hollywood business deals usually work, but it’s easy to see why Glynn is excited. Hiddleston speculation—and betting—has been on the rise at least since March.

Earlier this month, Hiddleston delivered a typically charming deflection of the rumors he was being eyed as Bond on The Graham Norton Show. “I promise, no one’s talked to me about it,” he said with a chuckle. It’s not the first time he’s had to deny it, and it won’t be the last. But this particular surge probably springs from the fact that a “source” told the Daily Mail that Hiddleston had been spotted meeting with Bond director Sam Mendes. Mendes, for his part, has already said he’s really done with the franchise this time following Spectre. And of course, Hiddleston’s reps have already said the storied meeting was “completely false.”

So, where does this leave Bond fans? Basically, right back where they started—waiting to find out whether or not Daniel Craig is actually done with the role, and brainstorming all of his enticing potential replacements. Except, you know, with no bets for a little while.

Kim Kardashian, 37, had a Christmas for the ages between her family’s star-packed holiday bash and her lavish gifts from husband Kanye West, 40. But the one thing she was hoping for and didn’t get was the arrival of her third child via surrogate. “Kim is getting antsy and she would have loved to have her new baby for Christmas and she is feeling very eager to start being a new mom again,” a source close to the reality star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. While she got to ring in the holiday with daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2, she can’t wait for the baby to come so she can do all of the new mommy duties all over again.

“She is so looking forward to all the firsts that she misses from Saint and North who have already gone through that process. The excitement is at a fever pitch right now to get that baby home and healthy and ready to be loved upon. She can’t wait for the surrogate’s birth process to start, she was ready months ago! ” our insider adds. While Kim might be eager to finally meet her new daughter, the surrogate’s due date is in early 2018 so it’s best that she cool her heels and have a healthy baby that is due on schedule. See pics of Kim and her kids, here.

Kim already had her pink-themed baby shower back in Nov. so she’s really been excited for this baby to arrive. With a surrogate carrying her third child, this time around she’s been able to avoid the dangerous pregnancy-related medical issues that made North and Saint’s arrivals so difficult. At the same time though, it’s been stressful relying on someone else to make sure that the pregnancy of her third child will go off without a hitch. Kim has chronicled how difficult that has been for her on KUWTK, and at this point we’re sure that the heavily pregnant surrogate as well as Kim are just so ready for the little one to finally enter the world.

HollywoodLifers, what do you think Kim and Kanye will name their new daughter? Any fun guesses?",0
47,"Kendall Jenner & Diplo were seen getting ‘super flirty’ at Coachella Embed from Getty Images

One of my most shameful celebrity “crushes” is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he’s a total douchebag. I can’t help it though – there’s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can’t always explain why we’re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he’s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.

Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music’s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky — and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer— who counts Katy Perry as an ex — at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ­Kendall’s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: “Kendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other’s company and hanging off everything the other ­person said. Diplo was ­stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ­wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.” The pair’s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall’s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party — thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald’s — basketball star Blake walked straight past ­Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood — although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: “Kendall has a lot of male interest and isn’t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ­flattered at the attention he was showing her.” I also hear Kendall is being paid around £450,000 per ­episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.

[From The Sun]

I’m sure some of you will be like “Kendall wasn’t flirting with Diplo because she’s gay.” First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It’s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it’s more than likely she’s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it’s likely that she’s the most “quiet” about her love life among the sisters. So… basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it’s true love. And she’s probably ashamed of herself and she’ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f–king hot).

Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.

48,"Caitlyn Jenner spills on sex life with ex-wife Kris Jenner in tell-all book The Secrets of my Life Caitlyn Jenner confesses to begging her ex-wife to have an abortion in her memoir ""The Secrets of My Life""

CAITLYN Jenner is getting candid about her sex life with ex-wife Kris Jenner in her new memoir, The Secrets of My Life, and her family are reportedly furious about it.

“We fall in love quickly (we marry after seven months),” Caitlyn, 67, writes in an excerpt published by People. “Since — let’s not kid ourselves — everyone wants to know, Kris and I have good and frequent sex at the beginning.”

The New York Post reports that Caitlyn, who underwent gender reassignment surgery in January, describes the sex as “imbued with love” but admits she wasn’t “entirely comfortable” with the act.

“I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her. This will always be a subject of dispute between us,” Caitlyn laments. “She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn, which obviously means in her mind that she did not know enough.”

While Kris appeared to be shocked by the transition, the former Olympian says that on a number of occasions, she dressed as a woman in front of Kris, 61.

Caitlyn also claims she had 36B-cup breasts, due to hormone therapy, when she met Kris in 1990.

As the years progressed, Caitlyn would steal makeup and clothing from her wife and daughters.

“I have bought makeup how-to books,” Caitlyn adds. “I keep the books, along with my meagre collection of clothing, in a small closet with a lock in the back of my closet. Kris and I have negotiated this, since she is terrified, as I am, of the kids finding something.”

Us Weekly reports that Caitlyn’s stepdaughters, Kourtney, Kim and Khloe are barely speaking to her since excerpts of the book began to leak.

So far the book reveals Caitlyn’s claims that the late Robert Kardashian confessed to him that he knew OJ Simpson was guilty of murder, that she has started sex reassignment surgery and also that she will never have another female lover and is open to exploring sex with a man once surgery is complete.

A Russian official tweeted (and then deleted) a photograph of Ivanka Trump sitting in between British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The move was heavily criticized, as a BBC correspondent noted that when a President isn't available to take his seat in meeting for whatever reason, it is usually filled by a high-ranking member of his office.

Here's a sample of the reaction from enraged social media users:

Had Michelle Obama (more qualified than Ivanka) filled Barack's seat at the G-20, the media and the GOP would be calling for impeachment. — Terrell J. Starr (@Russian_Starr) July 8, 2017

Kim On Crumbling Marriage To Kanye: 'We Did Absolutely Nothing' For Our Anniversary

Kim On Crumbling Marriage To Kanye: 'We Did Absolutely Nothing' For Our Anniversary

Kim On Crumbling Marriage To Kanye: 'We Did Absolutely Nothing' For Our Anniversary The couple celebrated their rocky relationship at IHOP amid West's drug scandal.

In a tell-all interview with Allure, Kim Kardashian admitted she and husband Kanye West did “absolutely nothing” for their anniversary, RadarOnline.com has learned!

The news comes amid the couple’s intense backlash over their allegedly plummeting relationship.

“We don’t do gifts,” she said in her interview. “We just did absolutely nothing [for our anniversary]. We spent two days in Santa Barbara, and we slept.”

“You know what? I think we went to IHOP. That’s what we did,” Kardashian, 36, added.

The queen of Instagram, reality TV and California then claimed that she doesn’t even “like presents anymore,” but it could it be she is just trying to cover up a deeper issue inside her marriage with West?

As Radar previously reported, West, 40, was recently caught in a shocking drug scandal related to his mental breakdown and hospitalization.

Chilling footage the rapper filmed before his breakdown was found earlier this month. The star’s lawyer Howard King however claimed it would not be leaked, as it could ruin West’s career, and “more importantly, destroy his marriage.”

What do you think abut Kardashian’s reveal? Do you think and West are still having problems? Sound off in the comments below.

According to Wednesday’s initial reports from Life & Style, the 25-year-old “Bad Liar” singer and the 46-year-old ex-husband of Jennifer Aniston have recently “become closer than ever.”

“They’ve known each other for years through their manager,” an insider explained to the publication, adding that their shared experience of both going through headline-breaking splits has pushed the pair closer. “Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups,” the sourced continued.

It’s all simply speculation—no confirmation has come from Gomez, Theroux or either of their reps—though Life & Style‘s source adds fuel to the gossip by suggesting that Jennifer Aniston, “is not happy” about the rumored love connection between her Theroux and Gomez, her former husband of two years and friend, respectively.

54,"Orlando Bloom Orlando Bloom is a popular British actor and heartthrob known for his roles in 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films.

Who Is Orlando Bloom? Born on January 13, 1977, in Canterbury, England, Orlando Bloom studied acting as a child before he was cast as the heroic Legolas in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bloom also found major success starring in three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with Johnny Depp. He's landed other roles in big-screen fare, including Troy, Elizabethtown and The Three Musketeers.

Movies

'The Lord of the Rings' Days before his graduation, Bloom was cast in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The first film of the trilogy, 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring, was a huge blockbuster and critical success. Bloom went on to perform in the two Ring follow-ups; he plays Legolas Greenleaf, a long-haired immortal elf who balances refinement and wisdom with sharp archery and camaraderie, throughout the popular film series. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' Franchise After garnering a noted role in Black Hawk Down (2001), another big part was on the horizon for Bloom. In 2003 he starred as the sensitive Will Turner in the Disney action/adventure The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, alongside Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. Pirates marked another huge world blockbuster for Bloom, who would go on to star in the next two sequels of the franchise: Dead's Man Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007).

'Troy,' 'Elizabethtown' Bloom continued doing period work, playing Paris in the 2004 film Troy, which also stars Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. The following year, the actor was featured as a leading man in two films: Ridley Scott's Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven and Cameron Crowe's drama Elizabethtown (both released in 2005). Then, in 2006, Bloom appeared with actress Zoe Saldana in the thriller Haven, which he also co-produced. In between his more high-profile Hollywood work, Bloom has starred in indie fare like Ned Kelley (2003) and New York, I Love You (2009). Additionally, in 2007, he returned to the stage for a London revival of In Celebration. 'The Three Musketeers,' 'The Hobbit' Another cape-and-sword opportunity arose for Bloom when he was cast in a 2011 update of The Three Musketeers, which failed to catch hold at the U.S. box office. The actor then returned to working with Jackson, reprising his role as Greenleaf for portions of The Hobbit film trilogy, the first installment of which was released in December 2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Bloom reprised his role as Will Turner for a fifth time in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) and showed his sense of humor in the Andy Samberg-led mockumentary Tour de Pharmacy, playing the character Juju Pepe. In 2018 he starred in the British-Chinese thriller action flick S.M.A.R.T. Chase.",0
55,"Jennifer Garner Stays Warm With Intense Over-Sized Scarf -- See the Pic! The sun may be shining in Los Angeles, but there's still a cool breeze.

Jennifer Garner stayed warm and cozy on Tuesday by wearing a multi-colored and oversized scarf (reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz's infamous outerwear he wore in 2012) while out with her gal pals in L.A. on her birthday. The former Alias star, who turned 46 this week, outfitted the knitted scarf with sporty black leggings, a gray zip-up jacket, red-white-and-blue sneakers and tortoiseshell shades. Her brunette tresses were up in a long ponytail and she carried a water bottle, coffee cup and her phone in one hand.

Garner later revealed on Instagram that that the massive scarf was a birthday gift from her daughter Seraphina.

""When your nine year old weaves a 12ft long scarf on a peg loom for your birthday present, you’d better #werk #fashionfriday #thecarpoollineismyrunway #proudmom,"" she captioned another pic of her colorful fashion statement.

The actress appeared to have been in good spirits during her birthday, turning herself into a meme and taking to Instagram to thank everyone for their well wishes.

""I’m having the best birthday and so much of it is because of all of you. Thank you for the birthday love! ❤️❤️❤️,"" she wrote alongside the silly pic of herself doing her hair.

Undoubtedly, 46 will be a good year for Garner as she makes her return to television with the series Camping, will kick-ass in the spy-thrillerPeppermint, and continues to treat fans to all her wonderful Instagram videos and pics.

See what else Garner has up her sleeve in the video below.

On Thursday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the daytime talk show host continues to celebrate her 60th birthday by having wife Portia de Rossi on the program.

Seated next to Ellen, the 45-year-old actress proceeds to bring her wife of nine years to tears upon presenting her with the ""best"" gift.

""It's your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,"" Portia explains. ""Not just now, but what you've always cared about. What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'""

She continues, ""So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!""

Portia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. ""So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,"" she reveals. ""Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!""

Portia didn't stop there! ""I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,"" she shares. ""So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do.""

Blown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, ""It’s the best gift. I’ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia’s line was, 'It’s good to be loved; it’s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me. So, I love you.""

In fact, the 49-year-old former Friends actress is said to be 'furious' and 'upset' by each new story, sources told HollywoodLife.

'Jennifer is upset over the dating rumors swirling around her ex and Selena,' one source said.

Jennifer Aniston is said to be furious to learn that Selena Gomez is allegedly dating her estranged husband, Justin Theroux

Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston announced on February 16, 2018 that they had separated in late 2017

'It hurts Jen to think that Justin would move on already. To think of him with anyone else, especially someone so young and that Jen has a personal relationship with like Selena, is painful for her. Jen doesn't want to think about it and definitely does not believe it.'

It's not just the rumors surrounding Justin, 46, and Selena's alleged relationship that have Jennifer in a tizzy.

The source told the outlet: 'Jennifer is tired of hearing about all the women Justin may be dating since their split.

'From Emma Watson to Selena, Jen is furious over every picture she sees of her ex with another pretty face out in New York. Jen won't believe any of the rumors until she hears from Justin himself that he is involved in a new relationship.'

Need a breakdown of this sordid love triangle? Here's what you need to know.

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux married

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are still married. Although rumors are swirling about both parties moving on following their February 2018 announcement that they separated in late 2017, they haven't made moves to divorce just yet and may not.

The couple tied the knot on August 5, 2015. They met for the first time on the set of Tropic Thunder in 2007.

Jennifer told PopSugar she thought Justin was the 'nicest person in the world'.

They met again in 2010 on the set of Wanderlust, which Jennifer starred in opposite Paul Rudd. Justin was dating Heidi Bivens at the time and had been with her for 14 years.

The following year, rumors began swirling that Jennifer and Justin were a couple.

Jennifer Aniston divorce

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are not divorced, though their statement regarding their separation does seem to suggest that they're headed that way.

The statement concluded with the pair saying: 'We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.'

Selena Gomez and Justin Theroux

Rumors have been swirling about the nature of Selena Gomez and Justin Theroux's relationship for some time now. Most recently, Life & Style reported that things between the pair 'have turned into more than a friendship'.

Previous reports suggested the rumored couple were trading flirty text messages.

A source told Radar Online: 'It was kind of an open secret that Justin was sweet on Selena when he and Jen hung out with her.

Listen if the rumors are true and Selena Gomez is dating Justin Theroux thats soooo gross he and Jennifer Aniston separated like 2 months ago and thats a 21 year age difference?!?! why — Leela M. (@leelz402) May 16, 2018

'To be fair they did get on well but he's asking for major trouble by trying to hang out with her so soon after his and Jen's split.'

The insider added that Selena, described as 'not the type to blow someone off who she genuinely likes', has been responding to Justin's texts. The source said at the time that this wasn't sitting well with Jennifer, who felt Selena, 25, was 'very much her friend not Justin's'.

Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt 2018

It wasn't long after Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split that rumors began swirling about her and Brad Pitt getting back together.

The exes were both thought to be single at the same time for the first time in many years and were rumored to be speaking again. There was just one problem — the Fury actor wasn't single at all.

Brad has been rumored to be dating an MIT professor and well-known architect called Neri Oxman.

Are Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston talking again?

Hollywood Life reported that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston had started talking again following her separation from Justin Theroux.

A source claimed that she was disappointed to learn that he was dating someone.

'Jen is crushed after hearing the rumors that Brad has been talking to a beautiful, Angelina Jolie-lookalike, MIT professor. Jen has her hopes up of a possible reconciliation with Brad since she and her ex started talking again,' the source said.

'When they both became recently single, Jen thought the timing couldn't be better, and she might have her fairy tale, happy ending with Brad after all. Jen never stopped loving him.'

Is Jennifer Aniston pregnant with Brad Pitt's baby?

Rumors have been swirling since April 2018 that Jennifer Aniston is pregnant with Brad Pitt's child. The rumors began after Women's Day Australia put out a cover, featuring a photo of the actress from a 2013 movie premiere, that proclaimed: 'Yes! Jen's pregnant!'

She is not, as GossipCop pointed out.

Brad Pitt dating

Neri Oxman, an MIT professor and world renowned architect, and Brad Pitt are said to be dating. In April they were rumored to have been celebrating six months together.

Photos surfaced of the 54-year-old star at the media lab at which Neri works. She shared the snapshot on Instagram, sending the rumor mill into overdrive.

59,"Why Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Never Leave a Dinner Date Together Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes have been spotted leaving dinner together in N.Y.C. twice in the last two weeks, but don’t ever expect the ultra-private couple to show any PDA on their way out the door.

“Katie and Jamie are still careful about being photographed together,” a source tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “Everyone knows they are dating, but they still want to keep it private.” So they make a point to exit separately.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

After first being seen dancing with one another in the Hamptons in 2013 — one year after the actress split from Tom Cruise following six years of marriage — Foxx, 50, and Holmes, 39, have made sure to stay out of the spotlight. When a photographer captured a rare photo of the pair together, walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach in September, they only became more cautious.

“After the beach pictures, they only spent time together at home and got extra careful,” the insider says. “But this year, they have been more social together. They often go to restaurants for dinner dates, or to hang out with friends.”

The duo sat next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, played basketball together on Valentine’s Day and were seen leaving Nobu restaurant in New York City on April 22, followed by Carbone on May 1.

60,"Gavin Rossdale: ‘If you divorce America's sweetheart, you're in trouble’ Better known as Gwen Stefani’s ex than as a rock singer, he’s now trying his hand as a judge on The Voice UK. He discusses Marilyn, Bush and a private life in the public eye

About an hour into Gavin Rossdale’s new job as a judge on The Voice UK, the ITV producers had a word in his ear.

“They asked me to up the energy, because I was a bit laidback,” he admits. “But then I’ve been told that for years on TV. I’d meet these presenters that were really loud and I’d think: ‘Why are you being so annoying?’ And then I’d watch it on TV and I’d look half-dead and they look normal.”

It’s understandable if Rossdale seems slightly low-energy today. He has been working since 5am, and for a large part of that time he has been forced to interact with the British press. For years, the UK music mags tore into his band Bush – mocking his private school upbringing and his embracing of angsty American grunge just as Britpop was sweeping that sound away over here. More recently, Rossdale has been tabloid gossip fodder – the ex-husband of Gwen Stefani who allegedly wronged her by sleeping with the nanny. And yet here he is, having to play nice for the same publications.

“I felt like a rag doll” is how he describes the experience. “I was not really saying anything and just waiting for them to cut me up like a sushi chef one more time.”

It hasn’t escaped my mind that Rossdale is sitting here talking to … a member of the British press. He’s polite and engaged, but he doesn’t trust me very much. Most journalists, he says, are nice to his face – “because I’m bigger than they think I am” – but end up stitching him up when they get behind their keyboard. I glance at the gleaming triangular ring on his finger, which would double neatly as a knuckle duster, and wonder how this encounter might go …

Rossdale was not an obvious choice for the UK version of The Voice. A massive rock star in the US who has shifted about 20m albums, he has been a comparative flop back home. He admits he was shocked to get the call – “I thought I was being punk’d!” – and a fair few “Who is Gavin Rossdale?” pieces made their way to publication.

Does he see the irony in being asked to coach UK pop stars when he struggled to make an impact here?

“For sure,” he says, grinning. “The reason why Bush never got signed at first was always that I couldn’t sing. But I believe great singers become great singers.”

Rossdale is a quiet presence on the show – perhaps a little nervous at first – but he scares the other judges with his smooth talk and his ability to win over contestants and convince them to join his team. In a canny twist by the show’s producers, his ex-wife judges on the US version. But Rossdale says other reasons are behind his desire to appear on it. Bush have a new album out in early 2017; this could be one last, unexpected, opportunity to try to break Britain. “I was clearly at peace with not having [done so],” he says, “but I always felt it was unfortunate we weren’t given the exposure that could have led to a few more people knowing about us,” he says.

I wonder what it must have been like, playing enormodomes in the US and then returning home to play pub shows to nobody, but Rossdale says it wasn’t like that: “We were having really killer shows [in the UK], but then getting destroyed in the reviews.” I never played shows here that weren’t packed, that weren’t full of people having an amazing time … well, apart from whoever was writing the review.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Swallowed, Bush’s biggest hit in the UK.

What was the worst thing anyone ever wrote about him?

“Oh, God, it just went on and on,” he says. “I stopped reading it, which was a much better decision by me. I still don’t. I had to tell my new manager to stop sending me press cuttings recently, but he’s still doing it.”

Even in the US, the press could be snarky. When Rossdale made the cover of Rolling Stone in 1996, the topless shot of him ran alongside the cover line: “Why won’t anyone take Gavin Rossdale seriously?” Is it true he had the cover framed, but pointedly crossed out the cover line? “It’s the only cover I’ve ever seen them insult anyone,” he sighs. “But I’m sorry, that’s not true. I wouldn’t bother framing a Rolling Stone magazine, although people do still ask me to sign it occasionally. And I always sign over the word ‘seriously’ and replace it with ‘to lunch’.”

The next morning, I meet Rossdale after another early start – he has just finished a This Morning interview, in which he seemed overjoyed to have met Philip Schofield (“He’s been on screen all my life!”). There’s no low energy today. We zip through Rossdale’s early life as a “painfully shy” outsider living out various dual roles simultaneously: he schooled at the ultra-posh Westminster College, yet hung around with football casuals from the estates near his Swiss Cottage home. He spent a couple of teenage weekends in an East End pub, serving jellied eels to gangsters and learning to double-salt the crisps so that punters drank more. Yet by 16 he had run away to start a new life – music was his main solace and he ended up frequenting hedonistic clubs such as Taboo and the Wag Club.

It was around this time that he met the popstar Marilyn, who has said they had a love affair he never got over, although Rossdale describes the suggestions it lasted for five years as “complete nonsense”. He continues: “I knew him for five minutes. You hang out with people and, when you’re young, you find out what you want … and that just wasn’t my world. I’m the biggest libertarian on earth, I have no qualms with anyone doing anything ... I couldn’t care less if you want to sleep with a telephone.”

Being asked about Marilyn is the closest Rossdale gets to angry during the interview – he says he’s fed up having to talk about something he considers inconsequential that happened decades ago. I notice he’s still wearing the spiked ring from yesterday.

“I wear it as my armour against you!” He swivels it around so that the spike is within his hand. “This is the friendly side,” he says – symbolically, I think, but then he swivels it back into spike mode.

“I’m not actually a violent person,” he says. “And I am fully aware that I have an incredible life and I should be grateful and shut the fuck up. I have no complaints, really. I mean, of course I have complaints, I have loads of complaints – I got divorced! It was the worst time of my life ever!”

Was he aware of how negative the press was about him?

“Well, if you divorce America’s sweetheart, you’re in trouble. Or rather, if she divorces me. So … I don’t read that stuff, but I know I’ve been portrayed as a bad guy.” Rossdale says his priority is his kids, so he would never say anything bad about her publicly. “She’s the mother of my children and one of the most incredible girls in the world.”

Are they still talking?

“She has a boyfriend and she’s busy … but I wish her all the happiness in the world, and that’s the true sign of love. As I’m sure your favourite artist Sting said: ‘If you love someone, set them free.’” Last year, Stefani released This Is What The Truth Feels Like, which dealt with their split in forensic detail: “I don’t know why I cry/ But I think it’s ’cause I remembered for the first time/ Since I hated you/ That I used to love you”, she sang on Used To Love You. Has Rossdale heard it?

“Erm,” he says, pausing for a while. “You know, I did hear it the other day in an airport.” He trails off for a moment. “Now I’m talking about Gwen more than I intended to. Fucking journalists! But, yeah, I walked through the airport and they had one of those little kiosks playing it and I heard the song about how she used to love me. So I stood in the store and listened to it from beginning to end going: ‘Okaaaay.’”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rossdale with Gwen Stefani. Photograph: Charbonneau/BEI/BEI/Shutterstock

What did he think?

“As a songwriter, I thought it was an interesting lyrical twist.” I assume he’s being evasive, but then I notice his eyes are filling up a bit: “It’s a lot,” he says. “Divorce is a lot.”

Was it horrible to hear Stefani singing about it?

“Well, I’m not sure what the parameters are,” he says, composing himself again. “It could only really be horrible, tragic or terrible, right? That’s the range. It never really moves into joy or satisfaction, does it?”

It might move into anger …

“Oh, no. Because I live in a glass house in a glass room in a glass bed with a glass bathroom. So I don’t say anything about anyone. If she had to do that, if she needed to do it, that’s her perspective and everyone has that. It’s just that … look, it’s bad enough getting divorced, but getting divorced publicly from her was fucking next level. But what do I know? Here we are discussing this against the Oxo Tower, and London is beautiful, the sun is shining and it’s the worst thing if you think about suicide, because people pass, they die and they go, and yet life goes on …”

I’m taken aback. Suicide?

“Life is like waterskiing,” he continues – and I’m not sure either of us know where he’s going at this point – “in the sense that you’ve got to make sure you don’t let go of the rope. And I didn’t let go of the rope. But if one year ago you said I’d be doing this, and I’d have a record that I have and the support that I have … it’s been a dark time.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian

Did he consider suicide?

“No, because I have children … but there were times when I 100% understood why people do it.”

Despite not trusting journalists, Rossdale turns out to be good company – funny and full of statements suitably ludicrous for a pop star (“Was I tired yesterday? No, because I’m a fucking warrior and I will outlast anyone at anything”) yet vulnerable and far more self-aware than I’d anticipated (“It’s all you want to know, really, let’s face it,” he says after the barrage of questions about Stefani. “I mean, what’s the new record like? Yawn!”).

I wonder if this more relaxed, honest version of Rossdale is one that not many people get to see. As we leave, he tells me that Stefani often didn’t want him opening up to the press, so he learned to stay guarded. But now he has a degree of freedom to do what he wants – he mentions on a couple of occasions about wanting to “become 3D”, so that people can go beyond the headlines and see who he really is: “And then be like … yeah, now I really don’t like him,” he laughs.

And how would he feel if people still didn’t like him? Or if the Bush album doesn’t take off? If all this amounts to nothing in the end?

“I just got divorced and I’m still alive,” he says. “So nothing can crush me. Nothing!”

62,"Bachelor Whitney Bischoff Talks Engagement: Didnt Let Past Close Off Heart Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.

“It was just perfect,” Bischoff tells PEOPLE. “I was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”

The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.

“On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”

Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”

Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”

Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”

Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.”",0

While it’s unclear where the rumors started, multiple social media users are claiming that the 20-year-old Lip Kit maven has been spotted at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.

“Is Kylie Jenner really in labour or fake news?” one user tweeted with pictures of the two screenshots that seemingly started the rumor that Jenner was seen at Cedars.

“@zax_to_da_max has source at Cedar Sini who says Kylie is in labor RIGHT NOW. #BabyWatch,” a fan tweeted on Friday, January 12.

“Inside scoop: Kylie Jenner is in labor. You heard it here first,” another user tweeted.

As previously reported, Us Weekly confirmed in September that Jenner is pregnant with her child with boyfriend Travis Scott. The following month, multiple sources confirmed to Us that the Life of Kylie star is expecting a baby girl.

Other fans think a screenshot from Scott’s Snapchat validates the rumor, but it’s is unclear when the snap was originally posted.

“Kylie is currently in labor, thank you Travis for confirming the rumor I spread as if it were my own child,” one fan wrote with a screenshot from Scott’s snap that reads, “Make it home to ya one way or another.” However, this is not the first time this screenshot from the rapper’s Snapchat has convinced fans that Jenner has given birth.

A Twitter user shared the same photo on December 26 writing, “Is Kylie Jenner in labor?? Travis Scott’s Snapchat.”

After all of the fan speculation, multiple sources close to the couple confirmed to TMZ that Jenner is not in labor.

Despite her popular following on social media, Jenner has never publicly addressed her pregnancy.

“She’s very happy about the pregnancy but she doesn’t want to share this with the world,” a source explained in the latest issue of Us Weekly, adding that the reality star looks great and is in good health. “Her not being out is strictly personal preference. She wants to keep this one aspect of her life private.

65,"Watch Jenna Dewan Sizzle In Dance Off With J.Lo In 'World Of Dance' Trailer We know all too well the struggle of squeezing into lycra on a hot summer’s day. And don’t get us started on what we look like when we attempt to wriggle into a wetsuit (the image of Free Willy comes to mind...).

However, one person who appears to have no problem with donning clothing of the skin-tight variety is Hollywood star Jenna Dewan, and we are in awe.

Last night, the newly single dancer/actress posted a video of herself dancing with her World Of Dance judges and let’s just say, she’s looking h-o-t.

In the clip, the mother-of-one - who recently announced her split from husband of eight years Channing Tatum - can be seen spinning, throwing her leg up in the air, and slapping her derrière.

For the dance-off, the star's blunt cropped hair-do has been styled into wet-look curls, which is perfectly complemented by her silver-hued smokey eyeshadow and pillar-box red lip.

In the clip, she also dances with Dancing With The Stars alum, Derek Hough, who spins the Step Up star upside down. ‘YA’LL we had so much fun making this for you!!!’ Dewan captioned the video.

The star’s post comes days after singer Nick Jonas was caught innocently flirting with the 37-year-old on Instagram following the Billboard Music Awards.

In a post of her outfit from the night, Dewan captioned the snap 'Billboard Awards- 'twas such a fun night!!! Thank you for having me! #bbmas', prompting the crooner to comment 'Twas. 'Twasn't it.'

Even Jenna’s stylist, Brad Goreski, was quick to pick up on the not-so-subtle flirtation tactic. ‘Omg nick Jonas commented!!!!’ he gushed.

In another promo for the NBC show posted by Jennifer Lopez, the Bronx-born singer busts a move in an oversized ‘JLo’ emblazoned sports jersey, much to the delight of her co-stars Dewan, Hough and singer Ne-Yo.

Kris Jenner is done with Caitlyn Jenner. It’s no secret the former couple’s relationship has been tense the past couple of years, but things really come to a head on Sunday’s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

The momager is frustrated with the former Olympian’s memoir, The Secrets of My Life, and doesn’t like how she’s portrayed.

""I read it and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time,"" the 61-year-old tells daughters Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian.

""But yet, he stayed married to you the longest. So, it doesn't make sense,” Kim says back.

""None of it makes sense. Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch and an a—hole?"" the mother of six continues.

In the memoir, which hits stands April 25, the 67-year-old claims Kris knew about her identity long before she decided to transition. ""I was curious and said, 'What the hell is going on?' She said, 'You just would never understand,'"" Kris says.

""And then, all through the book, Kris knew. 'Kris knew before I even made love to her.' I'm like, 'What?'"" As expected, the Kardashian daughters are on their mom's side.

""My mom's been putting in so much effort trying so hard to have a good relationship for their kids together,"" Kanye West’s wife shares.

""Caitlyn has every right to feel however she feels, but why bring my mom into it one more time? I just feel so bad for my mom.""



After years of working to repair their relationship, Kris is done trying.

""I really tried hard to improve the relationship and spend a little bit of time, thinking maybe there's something here that I'm not seeing,"" she says. ""I've done nothing but open up my home and my heart to a person who doesn't give a s—t. So, I'm done.""

67,"Angelina Jolie Emotional Over Brad Pitt Dating Neri Oxman Rumors — She Can’t Handle It Brad Pitt has fans buzzing about his alleged new romance with Neri Oxman, a beautiful college professor. While some are thrilled, Angelina Jolie is struggling over the fact that he may have moved on for good.

Angelina Jolie, 42, isn’t too fond of the rumors claiming Brad Pitt, 54, is dating Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, Neri Oxman, 42. In fact, “Angelina is steaming with emotions and jealousy,” a source close to the actress tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She doesn’t like to hear any of the dating rumors about her ex… She can‘t handle it.”

For the first time ever, or at least in a while, Angie has found herself a bit intimidated, which the insider says, does not happen often with the actress. “Angie saw pictures of Neri and felt a bit jealous. It’s Neri‘s incredible intelligence that has thrown Angie off balance,” the source admits, explaining, “An MIT professor is the last person Angie would have picked for Brad. Instead, “Angie might feel more comfortable if her ex were dating another Hollywood actress.”

Another thing that’s “unnerved” Angie is that many people are comparing her to Oxman in terms of looks. “She’s hearing that people think she looks like Neri and the whole thing is weird and uncomfortable for Angie,” the insider admits.

As Brad’s love life has taken over the news, Angie can’t help but be a witness to it all. However, “Angelina is also in a bit of denial about Brad‘s possible new relationship,” the source reveals. Why? — “She knows Neri is not Brad’s type, or at least doesn’t fit into his group of ex’s.”",0

Celebrity blog The Blast reported Wednesday that Springfield native Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are continuing to make divorce arrangements, and they've taken steps to keep the discussions out of the public eye for now.

The news was quickly picked up by national outlets such as People.

The Blast reported that both parties recently filed court documents to extend a ""temporary judge"" oversight period on their divorce case, allowing it to remain private while Pitt and Jolie continue to discuss dividing up assets and custody of their six children.

Currently, the blog reported, Jolie has custody of Maddox, Zahara, Pax, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne. Pitt has visitation rights.

The blog cited anonymous sources who portrayed ongoing talks between Pitt and Jolie as ""very amicable.""

The two film actors met on the set of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" in 2003, when Pitt was still married to actor Jennifer Aniston of ""Friends"" fame.

""Brangelina,"" as the couple is frequently named in celebrity media, got engaged in 2012, stating they did not plan to marry until same-sex marriage was legal across the United States.

In August 2014, 10 months before same-sex marriages were legal, they married in a surprise ceremony in France, where Jolie has family.

71,"Katie Holmes just can’t quit Jamie Foxx — despite his ‘publicly humiliating’ her with other women After escaping her reportedly intense marriage to mega-star Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes was probably looking for a sense of calm and stability in her next serious relationship.

But it’s questionable whether the “Dawson’s Creek” alum has found that with Jamie Foxx, with multiple reports suggesting that the Oscar-winning actor hasn’t been able to let go of his flirtatious, bachelor ways.

“No one understands why Katie loves a man who can’t seem to commit or why he’s publicly humiliating her like this,” an insider told Us magazine. “Everyone just wants her to take care of herself and to be happy. But she won’t let go of Jamie.”

Foxx, 50, sparked breakup rumors earlier this month when he was spotted partying in Miami with multiple women, while Holmes, 39, was in Paris for Fashion Week. Foxx also was seen getting close to his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis on July 4 when they watched fireworks together in Malibu. On top of that, the “Ray” actor was hit with allegations that he got rough with a woman during a sexual encounter in Las Vegas 2002 and tried to force her to have oral sex with him.

While TMZ reported that Foxx won’t face charges in that case because the statute of limitations had run out, Holmes is reportedly unhappy with his other behavior around women, Us magazine reported.

Nonetheless, Holmes is not ready to give up on the relationship, because she’s “absolutely smitten” with him, the insider told Us.

Page Six reported that Holmes was heard declaring her love for the “Django Unchained” actor after she boarded a flight to Paris. Suri, her 12-year-old daughter with Cruise, was with her, as was a friend and their nanny.

“Katie was FaceTiming Jamie after they boarded,” a source told Page Six. “She said she loves him and asked if he wanted ‘cookies from Paris.'”

Holmes and Foxx reportedly began dating in 2013 after Holmes divorced Cruise in 2012, but Holmes and Foxx went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret. That’s because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.

They still have never publicly confirmed that they are a couple, though they did the next best thing in September 2017 by being photographed together, walking on a beach in Malibu holding hands.

Then again, when RadarOnline reported in late June that the couple had split, Holmes representative went on the record to call the story “100 percent untrue.” Many outlets took the on-the-record denial as an official confirmation that there is — or was — a relationship.

Us magazine said there are other challenges to the relationship, notably the fact that Holmes lives in New York City and Foxx is based in Los Angeles. But they see each other “more than people would think,” a source said.

The key to Foxx’s hold on Holmes is that he’s “mesmerizing,” “entertaining” and can always make her laugh, the source told Us. So, somehow it works for her — for now.

“She has fun with him when they are together,” the source said. “It’s a relationship that works for her.”",0
72,"Maks Chmerkovskiy Skipped DWTS Due to a 'Chemistry Issue' With Partner Vanessa Lachey It’s only week 3, but the drama has already begun on Dancing with the Stars.

After Tom Bergeron opened guilty pleasures night by dedicating the show to those affected by the Las Vegas shooting, cohost Erin Andrews informed the audience that pro dancer Maks Chmerkovskiy wouldn’t be taking the stage Monday.

“Maks is dealing with a personal issue so Alan is stepping in and dancing with Vanessa tonight,” she said, referring to pro Alan Bersten, who got eliminated last week with partner Debbie Gibson.

However, sources confirm to PEOPLE that Chmerkovskiy did not perform by choice because of ongoing conflict with Lachey.

“There’s a big chemistry issue,” the insider says. “They both have big personalities and that’s not always the best recipe for a good partnership.”

PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with the Stars’ is on stands now.

While the former Total Request Live host, 36, has called the Ukrainian dancer the “best coach,” the source adds, “They’ve been fighting a lot.” (Reps for Chmerkovskiy and Lachey could not immediately be reached for comment.)

This isn’t the first time Chmerkovskiy, 37, has butted heads with his DWTS celebrity counterparts. In 2015, he told The Real of his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, “That’s literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future.”

On the other hand, Chmerkovskiy and Olympic skater Meryl Davis, who won season 18, brought out the best in each other.

“I feel that I can really be myself with Maks,” she told PEOPLE in 2014. “He pushes me to stand up for myself, whether it’s in real life or on the dance floor. It’s cool.”

He added at the time, “She lets me be creative. I’ve already done more on this season than I’ve done on Dancing with the Stars in 13 seasons.”

Andrews, now 39, has also raved about her experience working with the new dad on season 10. ““The reason why Maks and I worked out so well was because I come from a world where all I worked with was men, and pretty much I’m like a guy in a lot of ways,” the ESPN personality told PEOPLE in 2015.

When it comes to Lachey, though, the insider says last week could’ve been her last performance with Chmerkovskiy: “I wouldn’t be surprised if Maks doesn’t return as her partner for the rest of the season.”

However, a DWTS rep says Chmerkovskiy will compete next week.

73,"Taylor Swift Cuts Off Selena Gomez After Justin Bieber Reunion If Justin Bieber is your boyfriend, Taylor Swift would let you go! The ""Red"" singer, 24, has distanced herself from former best friend Selena Gomez after the Disney star reconnected with her infamous ex-boyfriend, 20, sources confirm to Us Weekly.

PHOTOS: Justin and Selena's complicated romance

Swift is disgusted that the pair are back together, cutting off her bestie after tweeting just last July that Gomez was ""the closest thing I've ever had to a sister.""

The ""Boyfriend"" singer sent his ex $10,000 in flowers and flew from Miami to McAllen, Texas to see her on March 7. Two days later, the ""Come And Get It"" crooner accompanied the Biebs to the SXSW music fest where he sang his hit ""As Long as You Love Me"" to her.

PHOTOS: Taylor Swift's best surprised faces

But Gomez rekindling of the Jelena flame isn't the only thing peeving Swift. She believes Gomez ""used"" a brief romance with the Grammy winner's pal Ed Sheeran last June to make her jailbird sweetie jealous.

""After Selena pulled that move, Taylor started distancing herself,"" a source tells Us.

PHOTOS: Justin's biggest scandals

And Swift has plenty of besties to spend time with otherwise. Recently she's been spotted with Modern Family's Sarah Hyland, True Grit's Hailee Steinfeld, Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss, and even Gomez's enemy, New Zealander Lorde. But while their friendship may be struggling, a Swift pal insists that the country artist-turned-pop vocalist loves Gomez and will always be there for her.

74,"Justin Theroux’s friends never believed he and Jennifer Aniston would last While the love story of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux had its fans, sources close to the couple questioned whether it would last, E! News is reporting.

Sure, Aniston and Theroux are both beautiful and talented. One appeal of this love story is that Theroux was well-cast as the hero to rescue Aniston, America’s TV sweetheart, from her supposed heartbreak after Brad Pitt divorced her in 2005 to marry Angelina Jolie.

Theroux is dark, handsome and chiseled (his form is well on display in HBO’s “The Leftovers.”). He also brought to their Hollywood power coupling hipster/artist cred as both an accomplished screenwriter and as a director and actor for Broadway, film and TV.

E! News pointed out that the couple had genuine chemistry and love for each other. On the other hand, “they were never really suited to one another,” people close to the couple told the outlet.

For these people, it’s not surprising that Aniston and Theroux announced Thursday that they were separating.

“They have always just been two very different people with very different characters who just happened to fall in love,” a source told E! “He’s more nomadic, more of a free spirit, he’s rugged and urban and Jennifer just isn’t that kind of person.”

Their romance became public in 2011, a year after they filmed “Wanderlust,” a comedy in which Aniston plays a married urban filmmaker who has an affair with the leader of a hippie commune, played by Theroux.

Theroux may have fallen hard for Aniston but he reportedly was bothered by the intense media scrutiny that came with dating the actress, who became adored for her comedic talent and her signature hair styles while starring on the hit sitcom “Friends.” Because of the regular paparazzi presence, especially in Los Angeles, the more social Theroux had to adapt to the reclusive lifestyle that Aniston had come to accept as Brad Pitt’s wife of five years.

Because of these and other differences, few of Theroux’s friends were “fully on board” with the relationship, E! News said.

The couple married in 2015 in what sounded like an intimate but star-studded ceremony in the garden of their $21-million Bel-Air estate.

Actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, a friend of Theroux’s, told Aniston in a Harper’s Bazaar interview that “everything about that wedding was perfect.”

“Everyone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy,” Sedaris said.

But the bliss didn’t last, according to reports coming since Thursday. The reports include the possibility that the couple began living apart this past summer. Sources near Theroux’s New York apartment told TMZ that Aniston had been absent from his West Village residence since August.

Sources said they saw Theroux in the West Village “all the time,” but that Aniston stopped coming. The last known photo of them together at the apartment was from Oct. 1, TMZ said.

Over the fall, Aniston and Theroux also were fending off a tabloid report in Life & Style that they were fighting over whether to live in New York City or Los Angeles, according to Gossip Cop. Life & Style reported that Aniston had recently come to the realization that “she’s just not cut out for city life” after spending a few weeks with her husband in their New York apartment.

Meanwhile Theroux wasn’t crazy about making Los Angeles their home base, Life & Style said. But in an interview with Gossip Cop, a representative for Aniston shot down the story that they were fighting over which coast to live on.

People magazine said Thursday that it was “telling” that Theroux didn’t pose with Aniston for an extensive photo shoot at their Bel-Air mansion for a recent cover story for Architectural Digest. The only photo of Theroux shows him outside with his motorcycles.

Aniston purchased the home for $21 million in 2011, and the couple spent two years carrying out extensive renovations on the modern, minimalist property that was billed as “their love nest,” according to various reports.

But Aniston admitted to Architectural Digest that the collaboration was initially a struggle for her. When she was single, she carried out home renovation projects on her own.

“Justin definitely wanted to be involved, so there was a bit of a learning curve for me on how to include another voice in the design process,” she admitted in the feature. “For instance, I figured out that immediately saying ‘No!’ to any suggestion is not the most collaborative move.”

People also noted that a feature in Architectural Digest is also looked at by many as a precursor to putting a home on the market.

Meanwhile, in their joint statement Thursday, Aniston and Theroux said they made their decision to separate at the end of the year. They were last photographed together on vacation in Cabo San Lucas over New Year’s, according to E! News.

It now appears that the couple, who have vowed to stay good friends, took the trip to Mexico to either make one last attempt to save their marriage or as a way to say good-bye.",0

76,"Why Isn't Gwen Stefani Coaching 'The Voice' Season 13? She Could Come Back Before You Know It The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)

This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.

Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.

Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""

According to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit ""Hollaback Girl"" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.

And, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time — it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. ""I don't have any plans to come back,"" she told the outlet. ""I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.""

The new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani's spot.

The Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair — because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s.",0

78,"Is Beyonce Pregnant Again? Fans Buzzing About Possible Baby Bump The Beyhive is buzzing! Fans are speculating that Beyoncé might be pregnant again.

The 22-time Grammy winner, 36, appeared to have a bit of a bump while performing in Rome on Sunday, July 8, as part of her On the Run II stadium tour with her husband, Jay-Z. Concertgoers shared videos of Beyoncé dancing on stage to “‘03 Bonnie & Clyde” in a formfitting silver minidress. At the end of the song, she rubbed her stomach and smiled at the audience before walking away.

The couple already share daughter Blue Ivy, 6, and twins Rumi and Sir, 12 months.

“Beyoncé is really pregnant again.. and she’s about to be a mother of 4 WOW,” one Twitter user speculated. Another fan quipped, “SHE’S CREATING THE NEXT DESTINY’S CHILD BEFORE OUR EYES.”

Some members of the Beyhive argued that the speculation may not be totally far-fetched. They pointed out that Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s favorite number is four, which could mean that they’d love to welcome a fourth child. After all, Queen Bey was born on September 4 and Hov’s birthday is December 4; they married on April 4, 2008; and Blue Ivy’s middle name comes from the roman numeral IV. In addition, Beyoncé released an album titled 4 in 2011 and Jay-Z dropped a record titled 4:44 in 2017.

Other fans were quick to laugh off the pregnancy rumors, though. “I’m going to believe that this is a food baby and she just dancing sexy,” one person tweeted. Another wrote, “She aint pregnant she had twins its hard for her body to snap back.”

Beyoncé and Jay-Z recently announced that they are set to headline the Global Citizen Festival in South Africa in December. It is unlikely that she is expecting as she would be in the final months of her pregnancy at that time. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises pregnant women not to travel to South Africa due to the risk of malaria.

The “Crazy in Love” singer famously revealed during her performance of “Love on Top” at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards that she was pregnant with Blue. She announced her second pregnancy via Instagram in 2017, breaking the world record at the time for the most-liked post on the social media app.

Us Weekly has reached out to Beyoncé’s rep for comment.

79,"Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston met secretly in London? Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are in the news again because of their rumoured relationship. A recent report alleged that Angelina Jolie's estranged husband has decided to meet Aniston in London.

Jennifer Aniston's fan was caught by surprise when she announced her decision to terminate her marriage with writer-director Justin Theroux. The news of Aniston and Theroux parting their ways came after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.

Many even wondered if Brad and Jen will reconcile their differences. There were several reports in the recent months allegedly suggesting that Brad's family was pushing him to marry Jennifer. A recent report allegedly talked about a supposed meeting between Brad and Jennifer.

According to a report from Grazia, Aniston is reportedly moving on from Theroux. As a part of moving on process, she is back on speaking terms with Brad Pitt and even planned to meet him in London.

""Brad and Jen have been in touch sporadically over the years, but a lot more consistently since she split from Justin,"" claimed the supposed insider.

The insider further claimed that Jennifer is in the UK for her upcoming Netflix project, Murder Mystery and Brad is also visiting the English countryside to visit his children. That being said, Brad Pitt was recently spotted showing off as a sixties hunk. He was pictured on the set of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in Los Angeles. At the same time, as per his agreement with Angelina Jolie, he is supposed to be in California for the next few weeks to be with his six children.

Meanwhile, in the released pictures from the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood movie set, the 54-year-old Pitt looks toned as he steps down from the car. The black tight t-shirt with blue denim gives him the 60s look everyone was hoping to see in Quentin Tarantino's next western film.

First look. #OnceUponATimeInHollywood A post shared by Leonardo DiCaprio (@leonardodicaprio) on Jun 27, 2018 at 6:00am PDT

In Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Brad Pitt will star alongside Leonardo DiCaprio as he steps on the shoes of Cliff Booth who served as Rick Dalton's (Caprio) body double. The film will centre on the lives of struggling actors and how their life is affected when Rick's neighbour, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), was brutally murdered by the member of Charles Manson's family.

Well-wishers are advised to understand this that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston haven't crossed paths in years and there's nothing going on between the former couple.",0
80,"Kim Kardashian, Kanye West’s ‘Last Embryo’ for Baby No. 4 Is a Boy Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have babies on the brain again! Seven months after welcoming daughter Chicago, the couple are planning to have a fourth child, multiple sources reveal exclusively in the new issue of Us Weekly.

“[They] have one last embryo left,” one insider says, adding that the sex is male.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 37, and the Grammy winner, 41, plan to have the embryo implanted in a gestational carrier “soon,” a second insider tells Us.

This will not be the first time Kardashian and West, who wed in May 2014, turn to surrogacy. They hired a gestational carrier for Chicago after the social media mogul suffered high-risk pregnancies with daughter North, 5, and son Saint, 2, due to preeclampsia and placenta accreta.

“Doctors said that it wasn’t safe for my — or the baby’s — health to carry on my own,” Kardashian wrote on her website in January, just three days after Chicago was born. “After exploring many options, Kanye and I decided to use a gestational carrier. Although I have used the term surrogate in the past, a gestational carrier is actually the technical term for a woman who carries a baby that she has no biological relationship to. A traditional surrogate donates her egg, is artificially inseminated with the father’s sperm and then carries the baby to term. Since we implanted my fertilized egg in our gestational carrier, our baby is biologically mine and Kanye’s.”

The reality star has long expressed her desire to have a big family. That said, she’ll likely draw the line at four kids. “I don’t think I could handle more than that,” she told Elle in April. “My time is spread really thin. And I think it’s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.”

Angelina Jolie (; née Voight, formerly Jolie Pitt, born June 4, 1975)[3] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. The recipient of such accolades as an Academy Award and three Golden Globe Awards, she has been named Hollywood's highest-paid actress multiple times.

Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), and her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Her starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with the war dramas In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), and First They Killed My Father (2017).

In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. She is divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller, Billy Bob Thornton and Brad Pitt; she and Pitt have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.

Early life and family

Born Angelina Jolie Voight in Los Angeles, California, she is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[4] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[5] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[6] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[7][8] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[7] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[9] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[7][10]

After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[11] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[12] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[13] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[14] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[15] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[11] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.

Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[13] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[16][17] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[16] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[13] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[14] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[18] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[11][16] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[19]

As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[20] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[21] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[18] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[22] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[14] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[14] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[23]

Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[24] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[25] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[11] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[26] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[27] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[28] They did not speak for six and a half years,[29] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[28][30] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[28]

Career

1991–1997: Early work

Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[14] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[13]

Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[14] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[31] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[32]

After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[33] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[34]

In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[35] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[36] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[37]

1998–2000: Breakthrough

Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[38] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.

Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[39] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.

In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[40] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[14] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[11] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[14]

Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[41] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.

In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[42] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's quadriplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[43] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[44]

""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[45]

Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[46] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[47]

In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[43] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[48] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.

2001–2004: Mainstream recognition

Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[49] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[43] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.

Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[50] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[51] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[19] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[52]

Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[43] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[53] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[54]

The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[55] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[51] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[56] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[43]

2005–2010: Commercial success

In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[57] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[43][58]

Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[59] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[60] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[61] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[43]

By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[62][63] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[64] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[43] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[65]

Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007

Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[66] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[67] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).

After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[68] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[43] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[69]

Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[70] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[43] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[71] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[72][73]

2011–present: Professional expansion

After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[74] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[75] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[76] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[77] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[78]

After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[79] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[80] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[81] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[43][82]

Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[83] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[84] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[84][85] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[86] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[87][88] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[86][89] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[90] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[91]

Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[92][93] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[94] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[92]

As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[95] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.[96] In 2018, Jolie was reported to be starring in and producing the upcoming film adaptation of a 2014 James Scott novel ""The Kept"".[97][98]

Humanitarian work

UNHCR ambassadorship

""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[99]

Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[100] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[99] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[99]

In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[101][102] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[103] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[99] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[104]

Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[105] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[101] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.

Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[106] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[107] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[108] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[109] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[110] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[107] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[19][111] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[112][113][114]

On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[115] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[116] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[117] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[105][118]

Conservation and community development

In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born adopted son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[119] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[120]

In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[121] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[119] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[119]

After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[122] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[123] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[124][125][126] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[127]

Child immigration and education

Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[104][128] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[104] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[129] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[130] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[128][131]

Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[132] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[132] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[133] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[134] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[135] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[136]

Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[137] which opened in 2005,[138] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[139][140] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[141] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[121] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[142]

Human rights and women's rights

After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[143] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[118][129] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[144] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[145] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[144][145][146]

Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[147] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[148] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[147] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[149] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[147] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[150] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[151] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[152]

Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[153] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[154] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[152]

Recognition and honors

Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[155] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[156] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[157] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[158] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[159]

In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[160][161] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[162][163] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[164]

Personal life

Relationships and marriages

Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[165] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[166]

During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[14] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[167] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[18] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[168][169]

Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[170] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[171] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[172]

After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[169] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[173] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[174] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[19]

Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in October 2005. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[175] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[172] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[176]

During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[177] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[178] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[179] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[180] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[181] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[182] On November 11, 2018, a new custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt.[183] On April 12, 2019, the court restored Jolie and Pitt to single status.[184]

Children

On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[185] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[26] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[186] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[187] in a local village.[18] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[188] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[188] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[189] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[188] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[174][190] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[174][191]

Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[192][193] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[194][195] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[196] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[197] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[194] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[192] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[198] having first visited the country earlier that year.[199] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[200] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[195] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[201]

In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[177] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[202] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to take these valuable photographs.[201] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[203] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[204]

On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[205] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[206] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[205] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[207] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[208]

At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[209] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[210]

Cancer prevention treatment

On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[211] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[212][213] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[214] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[212] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive salpingo-oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[213]

""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[211]

After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[211][213][215] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[211]

Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[216] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[217] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[218] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[219] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[220] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[220][221][222] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[223][224][225] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[220] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[226] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[227][228]

In the media

Public image

As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[25] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[229] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[229][230] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[230] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[14] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[231] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[14]

Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[104] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[104] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[104] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[232] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[233] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[234] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[235][236]

Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[237] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[238][239] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[240][241] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[242][243] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[71][244][245]

Appearance

Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[246] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[247] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[248] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[249][250] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates of where she first met her adopted children.[251] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[249]

Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[252][253] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[254] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[51] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[255]

Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[256] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[257] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[258][259] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[260][261] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[219]

84,"Howard Stern grills Jake Gyllenhaal on his Taylor Swift romance They only romanced for a matter of months, but it didn’t stop Howard Stern from hoping their relationship could have been so much more.

Speaking to Jake Gyllenhaal about his love affair with Taylor Swift on Wednesday, the shock jock said he wanted the actor to take it all the way to the altar.

Speaking on his Sirius XM show Howard told Jake: ‘I feel—and this is me stepping in—you should have married Taylor Swift, and I'll tell you why…What a power couple!’

Scroll down for video

Third degree: Jake Gyllenhaal was quizzed on his romance with Taylor Swift on Wednesday when he made an appearance on the Howard Stern XFM show

The Southpaw actor, 34, responded: ‘Oh, that's the reason?’

Howard, 61, who was now in his stride, revealed he was ‘super attracted’ to Taylor and said if he had been friends with Jake when they were dating, he would have told him she was worth staying with long term.

The Nightcrawler star, who dated the ‘Shake It Off’ singer for three months back in 2010 admitted: ‘She’s a beautiful girl.’

Romance: He dated the singer for three months in 2010

Jake joked: ‘Why didn't you have me on this show sooner?’

Howard, warming to his topic continued: ‘I would have said, “Jake, this is The One.”

‘Because to me, nothing is sexier than a woman who can play songs and write.’

Robin Quivers who co-hosts with Howard then brought up Taylor had written a song about her relationship with Jake – their break up is said to have inspired tracks on the Red album.

To the altar: Howard pressed the actor for details and then said he thought they should have got hitched

Jake, feigning ignorance said: ‘Do I?’

Howard chimed in asking which one it was.

The actor replied: ‘I don't know...This is all Robin. She's looking it up right now. She's feverishly looking it up online.’

Howard then asked Jake if he was in love at the moment, who responded he wasn’t.

When asked if he was upset about it, Jake replied: ‘Yeah. I love love, man. Are you kidding me?’

Howard then asked: ‘How many times in your life have you really been in love—really in love?’

Jake answered: ‘Three times but didn’t name any names. He then added: ‘Twice.’

Big love: Jake was asked if he had ever been in love - he said twice. It is thought he was referring to his relationship with Kirsten Dunst - they are pictured here at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in 2004

It is thought he may have been referring to his relationship with Kirsten Dunst, whom he dated from 2002 to 2004, and also Reese Witherspoon, whom he was with for three years from 2007 to 2009.

When asked if something held him back from getting married he revealed it was him and said: ‘I think I probably just got scared.’

However he also said: 'There are a lot of beautiful women, there are opportunities, but I think at the same time, if you find the right person, I believe in monogamy I believe in when you meet somebody who is right it will be right and you will stay there.'

Happy: It thought he was also referring to Reese Witherspoon, whom he was with for three years from 2007 to 2009

Howard also addressed Jakes appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, where Taylor’s song Bad Blood played in the background as the actor was being interviewed.

It became an issue on social media as it was thought the show may have been attempting to make an association between the pair.

Jake reiterated he was unaware of the music, saying: ‘First of all, I did not hear that...When I'm doing an interview when you're up at 5 a.m. and you can't really make sense of words, you're not thinking about the background music that's playing behind you.’

Oops! The star was also asked about his appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, where they played a Taylor Swift song when he came on set

‘So they aren't they sabotaging you in a sense?’ Howard asked.

‘Oh, please!’ the actor retorted. ‘Good Morning America?’

When asked if he would have recognised it was a song by Taylor Jake said adamantly he would.

Howard pressed on: ‘You are not defined by dating Taylor Swift. But they are defining you with a Taylor Swift song.’

Jake joked: ‘There are dark things that happen on Good Morning America. That is not one of them.’",0
85,"Khloe Kardashian Claps Back At Plastic Surgery Rumours With ""Pregnancy Lips"" Claim Khloe Kardashian has no doubt gone through a major physical transformation over the years. Her results could potentially be attributed to plastic surgery according to ongoing rumours. Recently, her plump lips have been at the centre of this discussion. Many have noticed a huge difference in the size of the public figure's lips. The noise was enough for the television star to address the issue on her Instagram account.

The new mother acknowledged the noticeable change in her features in an IG story post.

""PSA I was pregnant during this entire season of KUWTK. Some women get 'pregnancy lips'. I was one of them. So my lips look crazy and massive. Trust me I know and I HATED it! A lot of wild sh*t happens to your body and face while pregnant. It's out of our control.""

Kardashian urges fans of the reality television show to be kind about her onscreen transformation.

""Most people don't have to film during an entire pregnancy so just watch the show and be kind about my growing body and lips. Pregnant women should be off limits.""

Her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, has become a cosmetics mogul thanks to her artificially enhanced lips. Khloe seemed adamant in rejecting claims of her attempting a similar strategy.",0

87,"People believe George Clooney is going to run for president in 2020 Ever since Donald Trump, a former reality television star, was elected the President of the United States, we’ve regularly wondered if other celebrities are going to run for the same position in the 2020 election. In the last few months, we’ve heard rumors that Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Duane “The Rock” Johnson, and Katy Perry are going to run — and that’s just naming a few. There’s also George Clooney, whose recent donation has some people wondering: George Clooney for president?

The topic was first broached back in the beginning of September 2017, when Clooney was doing press for his movie Suburbicon. A reporter asked if he’d like to run for president one day, and Clooney said,

""Would I like to be the next president? Oh, that sounds like fun. Can I just say that I'd like anybody to be the next president of the United States. Right away, please.""

Nothing but respect for my President and George Clooney. https://t.co/x0aCjAI2RW — J. (@JojoCule) February 20, 2018

Now, Clooney’s latest actions have fans wondering if he might actually run for office. Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, pledged $500,000 to help fund the U.S. student-run march on Washington. Called the “March for Our Lives,” it’s taking place on March 24th, along with sister rallies across the country. The march is a response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that took the lives of 17 people, and it’s a way for the students who survived to take some serious action to demand gun control reform.

George Clooney will March For Our Lives ... pic.twitter.com/HlA8U2K4xW — Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) February 20, 2018

Shortly after the Clooneys made their donation, rumors hit the news circuit.

Fox News host and Donald Trump supporter Sean Hannity expressed his support, saying, “My attitude is, ‘Run, George, run.’ If George Clooney wants to run, I’m all for it. I think Oprah Winfrey would be infinitely better as a candidate than George Clooney.”

Hannity’s comments are sarcastic. What he’s trying to say is that he doesn’t think Clooney has a chance at winning, which is why he would want him to run — so that Trump could win again.

George Clooney for President. I'm not a fan in general, but he does more for this country then all the Trumps and their administration put together. — U.S. Blues 🌊🌊🌊 (@starshine731) February 20, 2018

Is there a chance Clooney might actually make a move?

Most likely not. His original comment about running was a joke, and when fans ran with it, Clooney cleared up any confusion in an interview with Variety, during which he said he doesn’t think celebrities should hold the position. He stated,

"" I think that having a celebrity as president who has a star on Hollywood Boulevard will exorcise our need to have someone famous in office. And maybe we’ll find someone who knows how to make policy.""

So, we probably won’t be calling him President George Clooney any time soon. But hey, one can dream, right?",0

On Friday, the married couple were spotted dining at Nobu in Malibu, where they were joined by a group of friends.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 37, kept it casual for their night out, tucking a simple grey T-shirt into a pair of high-waisted khaki pants. Kardashian West accessorized her neutral ensemble with a pair of heeled boots and two gold necklaces.

West, 41, also opted for a low-key look, wearing a baggy T-shirt with a pair of loose-fitting pants and sneakers.

89,"Is Meghan Markle liked by the Queen MORE than Kate? Newlywed set to ride Queen's train The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Camilla are all entitled to ride the Royal rail, but not even the Duchess of Sussex’s husband or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have ever used it on an official basis. Engagements attended by the Duchess of Sussex and the Queen will mark the newlywed’s first solo event with her husband’s grandmother. Such an occasion comes incredibly quickly following her marriage into the Royal Family and marks a stark contrast to the Duchess of Cambridge. The Duchess of Cambridge did not partake in an engagement with the Queen alone until almost a year into her marriage with Prince William.

The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Camilla are all entitled to ride the Royal rail

Such a move could suggest the Duchess of Sussex has formed a close bond to the head of the monarchy. In March 2012 the Duchess of Cambridge attended Fortnum and Mason with Her Majesty in London’s Piccadilly area to mark the store’s renovated restaurant area. However, Camilla also attended, meaning the event was not technically a solo outing for the Duchess of Cambridge with the Queen. Th Royal Train has been used since 1842 when Queen Victoria became the first British monarch to move around using the rail.

In addition to featuring carriages with dining and lounging facilities, there are also areas for sleeping. The train also features a bath that the Queen has used many times. It is understood last year members of the Royal Family travelled on the train 14 times. The trips cost taxpayers a total of £900,000.

Buckingham Palace has admitted using the locomotive is costly, but it argues the Queen finds using it more comfortable on journeys overnight and of a long-distance. At Christmas the Duchess of Sussex spent Christmas with the Royal Family at Sandringham House - this marked a break of tradition for someone that had not yet become a Royal. The Duchess of Cambridge did not receive the same treatment before her marriage to Prince William in 2011.

The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby has addressed the ‘embarrassing’ rumours she is dating Tom Cruise.

The actor, who plays the Queen’s late sister Princess Margaret on the Netflix show, responded to rumours that she’s dating her Mission: Impossible — Fallout co-star Tom Cruise.

Speaking on the Thursday episode of The View, she said: ‘I had met him once in a room full of people! I was like, that was fast!’

The 30-year-old was referring to reports she was ‘in line to be wife number four’ when she said: ‘We were filming on the river bank in Paris, and we have to kiss, and then the paparazzi [were] taking pictures.’

But Vanessa and Tom haven’t even had spoken about the awkward rumours yet.

‘It was embarrassing. Most of all for him probably,’ she said.

But Vanessa isn’t always facing embarrassment moments as we can only imagine she was pretty chuffed to win a Bafta Award just last month in the supporting actress category for her portrayal of Princess Margaret,

Her win, which gave Netflix its first ever TV Bafta, came after Claire Foy – who plays the Queen – lost out on the leading actress prize to Molly Windsor.

Collecting her prize Kirby said: ‘To Christine and Luke Windsor, and to my family. Claire, my sister, the best sister ever, apart from my real ones.’

The actor quickly thanked her real sisters after the room erupted in laughter.

‘No, but I actually do want to dedicate this to my sisters, Boo and Anna, because I couldn’t have done a second without them,’ she said. ‘I played Scotland the Brave on bagpipes nonstop at home when I was trying desperately to get into character. So, they were there utterly through it.’

The star also gave a tribute to the real-life princess, who passed away in 2002: ‘So actually this is for Margaret, wherever she is.’

93,"Jennifer Garner Braves The Rain To Run Errands After Ben Affleck Reunion Jennifer Garner stepped out on a rainy day to run an errand.

On Friday, the ""Peppermint"" star stepped out in Brentwood, California to run some errand even if it's raining. Garner was photographed all smiles as she walked out with a little rain on her way. Ben Affleck's ex kept herself dry by wearing a grey fur-lined coat. She paired it with blue jeans and black boots.

A few days back, Garner reunited with Affleck to celebrate their son Samuel's 6th birthday. The couple was photographed smiling as they walked beside each other. Another snap featured the ""Love, Simon"" actress holding Samuel's hands as they cross the street. Behind the mother and son duo are Violet, 12, and Affleck and his mom, Christine Boldt.

Later that day, the family were spotted at Legoland theme park in Carlsbad, California. Affleck shared a ride with Samuel and taught his son how to drive the boat. Meanwhile, Garner watched Affleck and their son from the sidelines.

According to one eyewitness, she was enjoying her day with her family at the park when their boat got stuck during the ride. When she looked behind her, she saw Affleck with his son.

""I recognized him straight away,"" the eyewitness exclaimed. ""He was teaching him how to drive the boat and letting him take the steering wheel. It was really sweet. His kid was just having the best time. He was smiling and having a great time. There were only two seats on the boat so Jennifer was on the side watching over them. She was letting dad and his son have that moment together.""

On Sunday, Affleck and Garner were also spotted attending a church service together in Brentwood. Their three children Violet, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel were with them.

Affleck and Garner called it quits in 2015. However, the exes remain amicable for their children. At the time, the ""Argo"" star is in a relationship with ""Saturday Night Live"" producer Lindsay Shookus. Meanwhile, Garner remains single but is linked to Josh Duhamel. However, some claim that their relationship is purely professional.

In November, the ""Tribes of Palos Verdes"" actress said that she's not seeing anyone. In fact, she's not interested in dating.

""I haven't been on a date and I am not interested in dating,"" Garner told Entertainment Tonight in November. ""People want to set me up and I am just like, 'No thank you!'""",0
94,"Revealed: Prince Harry had a crush on Meghan Markle ‘TWO YEARS’ before meeting her In a documentary set to air tomorrow, royal expert Katie Nicholl reveals that the smitten prince described the Suits star as his “ideal girl” two years before they met last year. She said: “He had a crush on Rachel Zane two years before he met Meghan and the reason I know is because I was having drinks with one of his friends. “She told me she’d been on a night out with Prince Harry. He was single at the time, so she said, ‘Harry, who’s your ideal girl?’ And he said ‘Meghan Markle from Suits.’” Prince Harry is said to have organised a meeting with his dream woman after having asked mutual friend Markus Anderson, a close friend of the divorcee, to set up a meeting between the two in order to fulfil his Rachel Zane fantasies.

GETTY The smitten couple struggled to keep their hands off each other during their latest appearance

The meeting reportedly took place when the 36-year-old was in London in July last year to watch Serena Williams play tennis at Wimbledon. According to The Sun, Ms Nicholl's added: “He asked Markus if he could set up, not a date, but an opportunity for them to meet and that happened in one of the private rooms of Soho House. “There were about seven or eight of them altogether and it was a perfect opportunity for Harry and Meghan to come together in a really informal environment and actually talk. “She was funny, feisty, confident and she wasn’t swayed or knocked by the fact that he was Prince Harry. She thought he was terribly cute.”

The royal expert revealed that after the pair’s first meeting, Prince Harry described the Suits star as a “cracking girl”. With the smitten couple struggling to keep their hands off each other at their latest public appearance at this year’s Invictus Games in Toronto, rumours of the couple’s imminent engagement have been ripe. Bookmakers believe Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will get married in Westminster Abbey in the second half of next year.

Recent reports stated that Harry had taken the Suits actress to tea with the Queen at Buckingham Place. Kensington Palace has not officially denied the meeting took place, which has only intensified the speculation. Any Royal wedding would attract hundreds of millions of viewers.

95,"Why Justin Bieber Had No Idea Selena Gomez Had A Kidney Transplant News that Selena Gomez underwent a kidney transplant earlier this summer shocked her fans, and it also took her ex Justin Bieber by surprise as well! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how he was totally in the dark about her operation.

If Jelena fans were still holding out hope that there was still a connection between Selena Gomez, 25, and Justin Bieber, 23, the fact that he didn’t know she underwent a top-secret kidney transplant should be proof enough that these two don’t stay in contact. The “Hands To Myself” singer shocked the world when she revealed on Sept. 14 that her best friend Francia Raisa, 29, donated one of her kidneys to Selena after her Lupus condition required the operation earlier this summer. Justin found out just like the rest of her fans via her Instagram post about it because they just don’t talk anymore.

“He is hearing about this just as everyone is hearing about it. He’s he is happy that she is okay, but he has no interest in contacting her to see how she is doing. This will not be a catalyst for them to talk again. He is generally happy she is okay, but that is all he wants to deal with right now when it comes to her,” a source close to the Biebs tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. See pics from Selena’s kidney transplant, here.

Even though they both go to Hillsong Church, Selena kept word of her surgery super quiet and the news never made it back to Justin, according to TMZ. The site says that the pair actively keeps their distance at services. “They don’t talk. Period,” their source claims. Another source said, “It was a childhood thing. They’ve both had other relationships. It’s over.” Isn’t that the truth! Selena’s been blissfully happy dating The Weeknd, 27, for nine months now and he was totally her “rock” during the medical crisis. Even though the singer was on tour, he stayed in constant contact to make sure his lady was doing well. Oh man, how stressful that must have been! If these two can make it through something as serious as an organ transplant ordeal, there’s nothing that can break their union.

97,"Kanye West Reportedly Reconnects With Caitlyn Jenner & Keeping It Secret From Kim Kardashian Are Kanye West and Caitlyn Jenner having political discussions behind Kim Kardashian’s back? A new report claims the pair have been in contact and that ‘no topic is off-limits!’

Kanye West, 40, has been spewing some controversial opinions lately, but he may have found an unlikely friend to voice his views to. The rapper has reportedly been talking and texting Caitlyn Jenner, 68, according to an OK! report. “Kanye was more supportive than any of the Kardashians about Cait’s transition, and they bonded at that time,” an insider told the magazine. “And Cait, being Republican, understands where Kanye is coming from with his political views. No topic is off-limits, and there’s no judgement.”

It’s no secret that Caitlyn isn’t on the best of terms with Kris Jenner, 62, or Kim Kardashian, 37. This is why the insider claims that the “Famous” singer is keeping his conversations private from his wife. Kim “is loyal to her mom and wants nothing to do with Cait,” the source said. “But Kanye’s just happy to talk to someone who gets him, and Cait feels the same way.”

As we’ve previously reported, the The Secrets of My Life author was pleased to see Kanye tweet in support of Donald Trump, 71, (unlike many of his fans and friends). “Caitlyn is happy and proud that Kanye has the courage to support Trump so publicly,” a source told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “Caitlyn knows first hand how hard it can be to have unpopular opinions in the Kardashian family. She thinks Kanye is being brave, just like she was for many years.”

But Caitlyn couldn’t quite get behind ‘Ye’s comments about how “slavery was a choice.” “However, Caitlyn has been left scratching her head trying to understand Kanye’s slavery comments,” our insider added. “She feels some of Kanye’s ideas are brave and bold but sometimes his energy is misguided or misunderstood. Caitlyn finds Kanye inspiring but fears his support of Trump will be dismissed because of his other outrageous statements.”

HollywoodLife has reached out to Kanye and Kim’s reps for comment. A representative for Caitlyn had no comment.",0

Laura Dern won an Emmy Sunday night for her supporting role in HBO's ""Big Little Lies."" And while she thanked her co-stars (many of them nominees as well) in her speech, she may have snubbed one of them on her way to the stage.

In the CBS broadcast of her winning the award, it shows Dern hugging co-stars Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley (who she beat in the category of supporting actress in a limited TV series or movie), but skipping over Reese Witherspoon, who also starred in ""Big Little Lies.""

People are freaking out over the apparent snub.

A more likely solution is that the aired footage simply didn't show the hug between Witherspoon and Dern. At the beginning of the shot where Dern hugs her co-stars, it looks like she's pulling away from Witherspoon, as if they had just embraced.

Laura Dern getting up, probably from hugging Reese Witherspoon. CBS

It's also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up. It's not totally clear.

Dern also, after all, did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her speech. ""I share this with my tribe of four ladies,"" she said, referring to her co-stars Witherspoon, Kidman, Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz. So there probably isn't any beef between them.

Also, it's just kind of awkward to hug someone in the seat in front of you. The chair is in the way. What's she supposed to do? Like, hug the back of her neck? Tap her on the shoulder? Everyone watching is waiting for her to come onstage.

Kidman and Witherspoon are themselves nominees in the leading actress category for a TV miniseries or movie, which will be awarded Sunday night.",0

According to Hollywood Life, the 25-year-old R&B singer, who allegedly has a nine-month-old baby girl named Royalty with long time friend and former model Nia Amey, wants to give the toddler a normal childhood.

""No disrespect to Kim or Kanye, Chris thinks they're both talented and successful people at their respective craft. But as parents… he wouldn't do half of the s**t they do,"" a source said.

""Parading Royalty around and taking her to places she doesn't have business being for the sole sake of having her photograph taken is not something Chris will be doing. That's absolutely crazy to him and he doesn't understand why anyone would use their child like that… for fame and publicity,"" the insider added.

It was previously reported that Bruce Jenner is upset that Kim Kardashian, 34, is treating North West like an ""accessory"".

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star previously received backlash on social media with people branding her a ""bad mother"" after dressing North in a see-through Givenchy outfit during the Paris Fashion Week.

Recently, North threw tantrums twice during the New York Fashion Week. The tiny tot burst into tears during her father Kanye's show with Adidas and the toddler also cried at the Alexander Wang runway show.

""Chris already knows how vicious the business is and he wants to keep his daughter as far away from it as possible,"" the source went on.

""The last thing he wants is for his girl to grow up around a bunch of fake people who cater to her like she's one of the Obama girls,"" the insider said. ""Chris didn't grow up like that and while he's going to give Royalty ever advantage possible, he wants her to know that she's not entitled to anything and that she will have to work in life.""",0

There’s nothing like a cute British accent to chase away the custody battle blues! At least that may be Angelina Jolie’s thinking, according to insiders who reveal to RadarOnline.com exclusively the star has fallen head over heels for a mysterious millionaire on the other side of the pond.

“Angie is keeping her cards close to her chest, but she’s very happy,” a source dishes. “She doesn’t want his identity to be revealed until her divorce from Brad [Pitt] is official, so she’s playing coy whenever anyone asks about her love life. She doesn’t want a media circus around her man.”

Sources say that the polished Brit is a reputable art dealer and philanthropist, and that Angie, 43, met him through mutual friends. “She’s introduced him to the kids already, which is a sure sign that this is more than just a fling,” says the source.

“They will always be her priority and she wouldn’t take that step if she didn’t see this romance lasting.”

Angie and her brood are currently living in London — where Brad came to visit for Father’s Day, even as the custody battle rages on — while she films Maleficent 2.

Sources on set say the actress only refers to her new beau “by one initial,” and has asked the producers to arrange her schedule so that she can leave town on weekends. “Apparently, they’re having romantic weekends in the English countryside, away from prying eyes, whenever they get the chance,” shares the source.

“This split from Brad has been dragging on and Angie is looking forward to the day the ink dries on the divorce papers,” adds the insider. “Then she won’t have to hide her new beau anymore.”

Justin Bieber thanks God he is no longer 20-years-old 0:54

JUSTIN Bieber is dating Hailee Steinfeld, according to TMZ — but the actress-turned-pop star’s team says they’re just friends.

TMZ reports the couple have dated for just over a month after they were introduced by Hillsong pastor, Carl Lentz. The singers both attend his church.

Bieber himself tweeted in 2011 that he met Steinfeld at the Golden Globes the same year she was nominated for an Oscar for her role in True Grit.

According to the gossip site, Bieber, 23, met up with Steinfeld, 20, in New York yesterday after she attended the Met Gala.

However a source told The New York Post the actress is not game for a romantic relationship with Bieber and has made it clear to him she’s “not interested in anything but a friendship”.

(2) Another photo of Justin Bieber spotted in New York City yesterday. (May 1) A post shared by Justin Bieber Crew (@jbcrewdotcom) on May 2, 2017 at 5:41am PDT

Similarly, a source told Us Weekly the pair’s relationship is not romantic, and that Steinfeld is still dating 20-year-old Cameron Smoller.

The couple went public with their relationship in December, with Steinfeld sharing an Instagram photo of herself cosying up to Smoller in front of the sunset.

A month later, they attended a W magazine event at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles ahead of the 2017 Golden Globe Awards.

Uh, congrats? — Scott Disick, 34, and Sofia Richie, 19, are reportedly engaged! “They’ve fallen in love,” a source tells Life & Style in the magazine’s latest issue. Scott proposed during a “candlelit dinner” when he and Sofia jetted off to Italy for a romantic getaway in early Oct., as reported by the mag. And, despite Scott’s admitted failed attempts at an engagement with his ex, Kourtney Kardashian, 38, and his multiple rehab stints, a source tells the mag that “he claims he’s a changed man.” The insider says “Scott is more well-behaved” when he’s with sofia. And, despite the 15-year age gap, “he feels that Sofia is the only person who understands him.” Yikes.

However, his alleged proposal didn’t involve a ring. The notorious partier is reportedly on the hunt for the perfect diamond for his new, leading lady. “Scott gets Sofia’s funky style and is on the hunt for the ideal rock,” the source says. “He went ring shopping in Milan, but he hasn’t purchased one yet.” Only the best for your one true love, right?…

As for the alleged wedding plans? — Well, the pair have a few ideas in mind, since the source claims they’ve been “talking marriage” for quite some time now. “They both want to tie the knot abroad on a tropical beach, with cocktails and champagne flowing during a casual wedding party,” the mag reports. “But, they want to keep their plans a secret for now. Once they make an official announcement, it’s likely all hell will break loose!”

While Sofia and Scott seem to be very happy together, there are a few people who are not fans of the pair; one, being his ex, Kourtney, the mag reports. “Sofia has been a Kardashian family friend for years, so Kourtney feels betrayed by her,” the source admits. “And, Kourtney thinks she’s too young to be dating Scott and playing stepmom to their kids” — Mason, 7, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 2. And, Sofia’s father, Lionel Richie, apparently agrees. “I am scared to death. Are you kidding me?” the singing legend reportedly said when asked about Scott and Sofia’s relationship in early Oct. Lionel has “accused Scott of being a bad influence on Sofia,” the insider adds. “Lionel’s terrified she’ll be led astray by Scott.” Talk about a tangled web.

Sofia and Scott, who have a 15-year age difference, have only been dating for a few months. The duo first sparked romance rumors at the Cannes Film Festival in May, and, they’ve been inseparable ever since. They’ve put on multiple PDA episodes, despite Sofia’s attempt at shutting down the relationship buzz back in May, calling the pair “homies.”

While Scott and Sofia have yet to verbally confirm their romance, they are Instagram official. Scott shared a photo with Sofia on his Instagram, and the paps have caught the two in the kissing act, as seen above. Scott and Sofia also traveled to Miami together in Sept. 2017.

We’ve got all the details on this new development in their relationship.

Angelina Jolie, 42, is having a hard time seeing the home she once shared with estranged husband, Brad Pitt, 53. Because she can’t bring herself to face it, a source close to them tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that she set up a secret rendezvous place for dropping off the kids. According to the source, it’s only “a few blocks” from the house they once all shared, and it’s hitting Angelina pretty hard. “Angelina struggles with going to her old home so she and Brad have set up a secret rendezvous location a few blocks from Brad’s home where Angelina can drop off and pick up the kids during Brad’s visitations,” the source concludes.

“Angelina has a lot of memories which make her feel emotional and she can no longer bear the sight of the home where she raised her children,” the source explained. “In order to avoid the painful, uncomfortable situation, Angelina and Brad have compromised by setting up this meeting point near the home.” It’s really sad to hear that Angelina is having trouble coping with her former family home, but we’re glad to hear that she and Brad have figured a way around it. Hopefully, one day, Angelina will be able to return to the home in order to pick up her children or even join them for a family dinner. We’re keeping our fingers crossed!

What’s more interesting about Brad and Angelina’s exchange point is that the source confirmed they’ve been seeing each other. It may only be for a few minutes, but it sounds like they are definitely coming face-to-face occasionally. “Their secret meet up spot is by a pet store, a short drive from Brad’s home, where Angelina used to live with all of the kids when they were still a family,” the source explained. “The location is also a short drive, only a mile or two, from Angelina’s new home with the kids, in Los Feliz, so the rendezvous spot is both convenient and necessary.”

1. Apology for ignoring British fans (2010)

“Wish I could have come out from the performance at the Mayfair but security wouldn’t let me. For those girls who cursed me out for it, I’m sorry, but sometimes I need to listen to security so no one gets hurt. But I like your attitude. The UK goes hard.”

2. Apology for ignoring Brazilian fans (2011)

3. Apology for ignoring French fans (2012)

“The other day in the airport I got surrounded by 20 paps. I don’t like small spaces, and I just wanted to get on the plane. I ran to get through the gate and there is a video of me running by fans and on the other side you don’t see the 20 paps. I would never run by my fans. For those that I did pass that day I AM SORRY. I know my fans are my everything. I know my responsibility to love them. I LOVE MY BELIEBERS.”

4. Apology for flipping off paparazzi (2011)

“Had a great bday and at the end of the night [Selena and I] got surrounded by paps and I reacted in a way I know better. I’m sorry. #killthemwithkindness. It’s not always easy but I know better than to react in anger.”

5. Apology for throwing up onstage (2012)

“I know that you guys don’t judge me, do you? You love me just the same, even though I’m throwing up all over the stage. You love me that much?”

6. Apology to Bill Clinton after cussing him out on video (2013)

“Thanks for taking the time to talk, Mr. President. Your words meant a lot. #greatguy”

7. Apology for canceled show (2015)

“I look forward to the opportunity to give my UK beliebers a great show in the near future and hope to honor my commitment to [the Prince’s] Trust at that time.”

8. Apology for canceled TV appearance (2010)

“Just want to let my people in Germany know I won’t be on Wetten Dass tonight as an accident has taken place and we all don’t think it is right to continue … I’m sorry we couldn’t perform tonight but some things are more important than putting on a show.”

9. Apology for smoking weed (2013)

“I also heard he got busted for smoking weed,” Bieber said in a Saturday Night Live sketch in reference to himself. “And he’s really sorry about it. And people make mistakes. And he’s never gonna do it again.”

10. Apology to China and Japan after visiting a controversial Tokyo shrine honoring fallen WWII soldiers, including war criminals (2014)

“While in Japan, I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine. I was misled to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer. To anyone I have offended, I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I love you Japan.”

11. Apology to Argentina for mishandling the country’s flag onstage (2013)

“People throw stuff on my stage all show and I get it to the stage hands to get off so no one got hurt. That video I saw a bra and thought it was a shirt. I’m being told by my team it was a shirt, but even if it was a flag I would never do anything to disrespect Argentina or the fans.”

12. Apology for walking off stage (2015)

“Sadly, it’s been a rough week for me, long days no sleep while having to be ‘on’ as they would say for cameras, fans, etc. In no way did I mean to come across mean but chose to end the show as the people in the front row would not listen … I don’t always handle things the right way but I’m human and I’m working on getting better at responding, not reacting.”

13. Apology for naked butt (2015)

“I deleted the photo of my butt on Instagram not because I thought it was bad but someone close to me’s daughter follows me and she was embarrassed that she saw my butt and I totally wasn’t thinking in that aspect. I felt awful that she felt bad. To anyone I may have offended I’m so sorry. It was completely pure-hearted as a joke but didn’t take in account there are littles following me!!!”

Not so fast Rumors have been swirling that Christina El Moussa could be headed to the “Real Housewives” franchise, but a source with knowledge of the situation told Fox News the “Flip or Flop” star hasn’t been in touch with Bravo execs.

OK Magazine reported earlier this month that Bravo was hoping to get El Moussa on “The Real Housewives of Orange County.” But so far, nothing is in the works, Fox News has learned.

“Christina is currently focused on filming new episodes of ‘Flip or Flop’ and has not been approached by Bravo executives,” a source told us.

El Moussa stars with her now ex Tarek on HGTV’s hit “Flip or Flop.” On the series, the two take dated, often crumbling homes and flip them in the hopes of turning a serious profit. Each episode chronicles the pair’s search for a property, construction and design work.

Christina has recently been sharing snapshots from the set of “Flip or Flop.”

107,"Andy Cohen recalls Jennifer Aniston and John Mayer's 'awkward' run-in It has been seven years since Jennifer Aniston and John Mayer called it quits.

But according to Andy Cohen, the iciness between the actress, 47, and the singer, 39, still hasn't thawed.

According to an excerpt from his new book Superficial, which was obtained by Radar Online, the pair had an extremely 'awkward' run-in earlier this year.

'Awkward': Andy Cohen has revealed that exes John Mayer and Jennifer Aniston had a run-in earlier this year. They are seen here in 2009 at the hotel where they bumped into each other

Andy revealed that he was meeting his close friend John for a drink at the popular Sunset Tower hotel in West Hollywood and found Jennifer sitting with her Friends co-stars Lisa Kudrow and Courteney Cox at the only other table there.

The 48-year-old said he 'began asking John when was the last time he saw Aniston, how awkward this was, and if there were ways I could make it more awkward'.

Andy added: 'We realized they had to walk by our table to leave and that would be a ""moment."" We wondered if it was more fun at our table or theirs.'

Snubbed: The Friends star (shown in September) apparently ignored the singer (pictured last month) when they were seated near each other at the Sunset Tower hotel

The Watch What Happens Live host suggested that John join him in going over to say hello, but that John made it very clear this would be a bad idea.

'He told me with a look that the Queen of Smartwater would not be having it,' he wrote.

According to Radar, Andy and John left first and the bitter exes didn't have to come face to face.

Juicy: Andy, who is close friends with John, recalled the encounter in his new book Superficial

John and Jennifer dated on and off for a year from 2008 to 2009.

The Your Body Is A Wonderland hit-maker described his feelings for Jennifer in 2010 during an interview with Playboy.

'We just have a regard for each other’s feelings that is pretty intense,' he said. 'It’s been a deep relationship, and it’s no longer taking place at all. Have you ever loved somebody, loved her completely, but had to end the relationship for life reasons?'

Not so amicable exes: John has discussed ending his relationship with Jen 'for life reasons' in the years following their split in 2009. They are pictured in 2008

He later told Rolling Stone: 'I've never really gotten over it. It was one of the worst times of my life.'

John has also dated the likes of Jessica Simpson and Taylor Swift, most recently ending a relationship with Katy Perry in 2015 after dating on and off for three years.

Meanwhile Jennifer has been in a relationship with Justin Theroux for five years, and they celebrated their first wedding anniversary in August.",0
108,"Rihanna: shocked by the secret child of Chris Brown! According to TMZ, Chris Brown is the father of a 9-month-old girl born of his secret union with a model named Nia! The child would have been conceived in September 2013. At that time, the love life of the rapper was difficult to follow, once Rihanna, once Karrueche … But finally the singer of “Loyal” has his heart set on the 26 years old model…

If ever since the couple leads a complicated relationship between the “Love you, love you nots” and Chris troubles with the justice, Karrueche has always supported her bad boy, saying she was ready to marry him even though he went to prison. But faced with this surprising news, the young woman decided to officially stop this tormented relationship through her Twitter account:

“Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me.”

Apparently unaware of the existence of this child, Karrueche was also taken for a fool. In fact, the child’s mother is not a stranger to her.

TMZ found a picture where we can see Karrueche posing with her arm around Nia‘s neck at a party in Las Vegas. One of her best friends, Christina Milian, was also here and so was Breezy who has not been a very good boy that day. The pictures were taken in May 2013 a few months before Nia was pregnant.

If the singer has still not commented on the topic, a source close to him declares that “he is happy to be a dad” and that “he wants to be present in the life of his daughter!”

Rihanna shocked by the news is convinced that he will fulfill his father’s job. If she has read the article several times before digesting the news, she thinks “ Chris will be a good father and take care of his little girl. That’s a big responsibility and something that requires a lot of work, energy and love. She wishes him all the best in this new and very important chapter in his life”, said a source to Hollywood Life.

109,"Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are 'fully back together' following cheating scandal and baby: report Khloe Kardashian may be ready to give Tristan Thompson another chance following reports that he cheated on her while she was pregnant with their daughter, True.

On Friday, an insider revealed to US Weekly that Kardashian and Thompson are ""fully back together,"" despite the fact that prior to their daughter's birth, videos and photos of the basketball star visibly cheating on the reality star with at least five different women surfaced back in April.

Now that the two have reportedly decided to move on from the past, the source said that new mom thinks that “the whole world is against Tristan,” and “no one in her world is supporting Tristan and she’s still in love with him.”

According to the source, Kardashian has viewed the photos and videos of her boyfriend with the various other women.

“Those around Khloé are trying to be as supportive to her as they can. It’s hard because if everyone distances themselves from Tristan, they’ll risk losing Khloé,” the insider explained. “Luckily there’s this buffer time. She always planned to stay in Cleveland the first three months. Now with Tristan in the playoffs for possibly another month, no decision needs to be made right now.”

Rumors began to swirl that the couple may have gotten back together after the pair were snapped on Friday, laughing and chatting together at what appeared to be a lunch with friends in Cleveland.

According to TMZ, a week ago Kardashian was said to be ""done"" with her 27-year-old boyfriend and decided to stay in Cleveland for the baby while Thompson travels for the NBA playoffs. But things seemed have changed for the new mom in just a week.

Another source also confirmed to People on Friday that Thompson “is back at the Cleveland house” with Kardashian and their 3-week-old daughter, after it was reported that the basketball player was not allowed in the house following the days of True's birth.

“Khloé seems happy,” the source told People. “She loves being a mom. She’s focused on keeping her family together. She seems okay with Tristan — there’s no talk of a split.”

The news of Kardashian and Thompson's reported reconciliation comes after her family members, Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian, did interviews on ""The Ellen Show"" and commented Thompson's recent cheating allegations.

“It's so f—ed up,"" Kim said of the basketball player's cheating.

In another episode, Jenner explained that her daughter, the new mom, was ""still figuring it out.""

“I’m so proud of that kid. I get choked up because she’s such a good mom, and honestly I get so emotional,” she shared. “I was in Cleveland last week, it was snowing, and she was all nestled in the nursery and the baby. She’s just concentrating on that, just being a mom, her baby and that’s what her sisters are doing as well. She’s so excited about motherhood and trying to get the nursing thing down, which is a little tricky. She’s trying, she’s really trying. That was a little bit tricky when I was there … She’s figuring it out one day at a time, she’s just the best mom already. That baby is so cute, little True.”

Two days ago, Kardashian disabled her comments on her Instagram. The reason for her social media action is unknown.",0

111,"Mariah worried ex-manager will leak secrets after split? Mariah Carey is not ""worried"" her former manager Stella Bulochnikov will start ""dishing dirt"" about her, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this inaccurate claim. We're told the singer has no fears whatsoever about her ex-manager leaking secrets.



According to the National Enquirer, following her split from Bulochnikov, Carey has become concerned her one-time manager will tell-all about her. A seemingly fabricated source is quoted in the supermarket tabloid as rattling off a handful of embarrassing moments for the singer and then alleging Carey's ""worried"" Bulochnikov will share what really ""happened"". The questionable ""tattletale"" says, ""Stella knows everything about Mariah. She knows where the bodies are buried.""



The alleged insider adds that Bulochnikov ""knows what exactly happened with Mariah's sudden split from her billionaire boyfriend James Packer, and she knows the truth about what really went down with that disastrous New Year's Eve performance in Times Square. Her fear is all her deep, dark secrets are about to leak."" And it appears the magazine's fear is fact-checking.



If the tabloid really had an inside source (or even nominally followed celebrity reporting), it would not have referred to Packer as Carey's ""billionaire boyfriend"". It more would have more accurately used the term ""ex-fiance"". Regardless of that fairly obvious reporting flaw, Gossip Cop still looked into the magazine's claim.



Guess what? Carey is not remotely ""worried"" about Bulochnikov leaking her ""deep, dark secrets"". A mutual friend of ours and Carey's not only called the tabloid's article ""ridiculous"", but also assured us that the singer ""knows as much about Stella"", which should serve as enough of a deterrent for her ex-manager to not open her mouth.



Maybe it's finally time for the Enquirer to find better, more reliable Carey sources. Gossip Cop has busted the outlet on several occasions for it misguided stories about the singer. When she was still with Packer, the tabloid wrongly reported Carey's 35-carat engagement ring was fake. And after that relationship ended, the magazine falsely claimed Carey and boyfriend Bryan Tanaka had sex in a restaurant bathroom.



While it's true Carey and Bulochnikov split, the singer is not even slightly ""worried"" her ex-manager will blab about her personal life. In fact, following their parting of ways, Bulochnikov noted in a statement that they'll ""remain partners in a number of business ventures, and will continue to support each other"". Call us crazy, but we'll take the magazine's word over the magazine's.

After another rough spell for the couple, and Miley recently admitting she doesn’t “envision” getting married anytime soon, it appears the power couple are about to call off their engagement for a second time.

A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.

“She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.

“They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”

Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun.",0
113,"Angelina Jolie: ‘I don’t enjoy being single’ Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have gone head-to-head in their divorce for months now, since they announced their separation back in September. But the couple is calling a truce, for the sake of their 6 children. The ex couple released a joint statement late last night which will seemingly end the back-and-forth drama in their Hollywood divorce. âThe parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues,â the statement said. âThe parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.â Basically this means the couple is going work together, but it also means we wonât be in the loop going forward, which isnât necessarily a bad thing for the couple. This new statement comes after a judge initially denied Bradâs request for privacy in his custody battle. Last month the actor asked for the custody documents to be sealed, but they were not. Angelinaâs lawyers felt Brad only wanted to protect himself and not the childrensâ well-being.

ONE year after parting ways with Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie has revealed she’s still dealing with the negative effects.

“It’s been difficult. I don’t enjoy being single,” the mother of six told the UK’s Sunday Telegraph . “There’s nothing nice about it. It’s just hard.”

Jolie and Pitt were together a total of 12 years and married for just two years before calling it quits in September 2016.

“Sometimes maybe it appears I’m pulling it all together,” the 42-year-old actress said. “But really I am just trying to get through my days.”

While Jolie continues to sort out the details of her life, she’s also been facing some health concerns.

In 2013, the Maleficent actress underwent a double mastectomy, she also had her ovaries removed in 2015. And earlier this year, she revealed she’s dealing with hypertension and developed Bell’s Palsy.

“Emotionally it’s been a very difficult year,” she said. “And I have some other heath issues. So my health is something I have to monitor.”

Taking it a step further, she describes how her body is doing.

“I feel sometimes that my body has taken a hit, but I try to laugh as much as possible,” she said. “We tend to get so stressed that our children feel our stress when they need to feel our joy. Even if you are going through chemo, you need to find the ability to love and laugh. It may sound like a postcard, but it’s true.”

Now that Jolie doesn’t have any acting or directing projects on the table and her kids are getting older, she will refocus her time.

“I think now I need to rediscover a little bit of the old me,” she says. “I think we lose our way a bit. I have had a lot happen in my life, from certain people passing to health issues to raising the children. And it’s been a very good time to absorb and develop and grow.”

It comes after the former couple’s biographer, Ian Halperin, told The Mail on Sunday that they are “back together” after intense spiritual counselling.

We always knew Andy Cohen, 49, was great friends with the Kardashian family. However, we didn’t know they were so close that Khloe Kardashian, 33, would name her first child after the Bravo host! Well, it’s a joke, but a clever joke at that, that had fans in a tizzy during a Twitter exchange on April 8. “Can’t wait to meet baby Andy! (That’s the name right?!),” Andy tweeted at Khloe while discussing The Real Housewives of Atlanta. “I mean, I was going to surprise you but you guessed her name,” Khloe replied, clearly joking that she’s already planned to name her baby after Andy.

The Bravo host then told Khloe she has “an OPEN invite” to the reunion [which is three parts]. Khloe said she would totally be there, however, the “only thing” holding her back is that she’s “about to give birth.” — Which leads up to the most recent report involving her pregnancy.

Khloe is reportedly in labor, according to TMZ on April 9.

117,"Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan spark feud rumors A little less than a year after his hasty exit from Live With Kelly, Michael Strahan is reportedly at odds with yet another of his early morning co-hosts.

The popular ABC personality and longtime Good Morning America host Robin Roberts are rumored to be feuding after photos emerged of the pair having what looked to be a heated argument on the morning of January 26 while on the set of their show.

But the rumor turns out to be just that, with multiple people who have knowledge of the situation telling DailyMail.com that the pictures in question show Strahan and Roberts in an animated conversation about sports with ESPN reporter Tom Rinaldi, a guest on the program that morning.

The exact nature of the talk is not known, but the three were likely discussing the news coming out of Australia just hours prior that Venus and Serena Williams would be meeting in their first Grand Slam final in eight years.

Scroll down for video

Heated hosts: Rumors emerged earlier this week that Good Moring America co-hosts Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan were feuding on set

Less than optimal optics: The pair were photographed on the set of the popular ABC morning show January 26 having an animated conversation

Making a point: Roberts could be seen motioning with her hands while speaking with ESPN reporter Tom Rinaldi as Strahan stood silently by her side

The day the photos were taken was perhaps the biggest news day of the year to date at the show, which started off the morning by airing exclusive footage from World News Tonight anchor David Muir's exclusive sitdown with President Donald Trump.

It was the newly inaugurated commander-in-chief's first network interview of his presidency.

The show that day also focused on the news that television icon Mary Tyler Moore had passed away one day prior.

Then came Rinaldi's segment on the program about the Williams sisters showdown in Melbourne, with the two both having won their semifinal matches in the Australian Open shortly before airtime to set up a meeting in the finals of the Grand Slam event.

Strahan introduced Rinaldi, who broke down the story as Roberts and her retired football player co-host both excitedly talked about the news on air.

It was featured on the Big Board segment of the show, during which the talking heads are normally not in the studio with the hosts, but that was not the case on the day in question.

Historic day: Multiple sources with knoledge of the situation tell DailyMail.com that the three were excitedly discussing Venus and Serena Williams

Shut it down: 'The only disagreement on set was over who was going to win the Super Bowl' said an insider

Rinaldi was actually in Times Square with Starhan and Roberts, and the three sat down at the desk to the side of the anchor's table to discuss the story.

After raving about the talent of the girls and this 'imprabable' meting, Roberts discussed how amazing it was that the pair's parents predicted this success for their daughters decades ago.

The two then joked about how Strahan, like the Williams sisters continued his career into his mid-thirties and noted how 'dapper' Rinaldi looked in his suit before the show went to commercial break.

It was right before that Big Board segment when photos were taken that showed Roberts gesturing towards Rinaldi while Strahan stood by her side.

Some thought that the ESPN host was a producer and Roberts was complaining about Strahan, but in fact the three were just discussing the sisters win before the show returned to air.

And as seen during the segment, Roberts,m Strahan and Rinaldi were all in jovial moods and did not appear to have just had a heated discussion.

Mistaken identity: The rumors began when some thought that Rinadi was a producer for the program to whom Roberts was voicing complaints

After rumors began to fly about a possible feud and insider said: 'The only disagreement on set was over who was going to win the Super Bowl. Everyone at GMA is thrilled to have Michael on the show full-time. He’s a fantastic addition to the team.'

Roberts publicly stated how fond she was of Strahan too earlier this week when she posted a photo of him laughing on the set to her Twitter account - on Valentine's Day.

She wrote that Strahan 'does make me laugh...he brightens my morning every day!'

That was followed by an emoji with two giant heart-eyes.

Strahan returned the love by retweeting Roberts and adding a emoji of a kissing face that same day.

Live in person: Rinaldi's report came during the show's Big Board segment, and he was live in studio that day

Rumors of tension on set are nothing new to Strahan.

News of his departure last April from Live With Kelly & Michel was surrounded by drama after Ripa did not turn up for work the day after it was announced he was moving to Good Morning America full-time come September.

Ripa, it turned out, had been blindsided by the news and it was a week before she returned to her hosting duties.

'I wasn't surprised by her reaction at all, but I can't control somebody else's actions,' he reflected later in a interview with People.

'I was there four years, and it's about more than just being in front of the camera.'

Strahan, 44, who had been on Live! for four years, added: 'Toward the end of it all, we didn't communicate that much. I kinda looked at it like, ""It was what it was.""

Keeping quiet: Strahan and Roberts were also seen quietly sitting next to one another during breaks

Roberts expressed her love for Strahan on Valentine's Day, tweeting about how much he makes her laugh

Strahan shared his admiration for his co-host by retweeting the message and adding an emoji

'The show was going well? We're all winning. That's all that matters to me.'

The drama was so bad that Strahan left Live! earlier than planned at the network's request, leaving Kelly, 46, to begin the process of finding a new co-host.

'The most disappointing thing to me was that I was painted as the bad guy,' said Strahan.

'I value the way I carry myself,' he said. 'I don't want people to see me as ""Oh, he just ran out, just left them there."" That's just not true.

'On air all I could do was control myself. In football, New York is the toughest place to play. One day you're the greatest player they've ever seen, then the next game you're the worst.

'But I got older in that business and I said, ""Hey, it doesn't matter what their opinion is. All I know is I'm doing my best, and I'm giving it everything I have.""'

Strahan also said of his relationship with Ripa: 'At one point I think we were friends. I don't know what happened in the end'.

Reading glasses: The pair used their commercial breaks to prep for upcoming segments on that day

Executives at ABC were apparently less than thrilled with Strahan however after his comments about Ripa in that interview.

'They were livid,' a source told DailyMail.com about the reaction of multiple executives when they read the story.

'Things had finally calmed down and then he goes and does this interview, throwing Ben Sherwood under the bus.'

Sherwood, the rpesident of ABC, had just issued a public apology to Ripa and about how the situation was handled just one week prior.

A spokesperson for ABC shot down claims that anyone at the network was 'livid,' pointing out that Strahan's story got its own segment on the program the week that it hit newsstands.

That segment did not however mention Strahan's comments about Ripa or Live

The source also said that the team at Good Morning America was also less than thrilled with the Strahan story.

'They think it looks like he came in with his own agenda - which is himself,' said the source.

Strahan was also involved in a feud with former Live co-host Kelly Ripa after he decided to leave the show for GMA

'It is just clear that he is always trying to blame everyone but himself for what happened when in fact he is the one who said on Live two years ago that he would never leave the show and wasn't going anywhere.'

Ripa made it clear she was angry with both the network and Strahan when she learned he was leaving the show for Good Morning America on April 19 only an hour before it was publicly announced.

After missing four episodes, Ripa held hands with Strahan as she returned to the set on April 26 and joked that the 'long national nightmare' was over.

'I needed a couple days to gather my thoughts,' she told the audience that day.

'After 26 years with this company, I earned the right. Let's be honest, I know half of you called in sick to be here, so we get each other.'

Ripa added that 'apologies have been made' and said she was thrilled for Strahan, who was chosen to be Regis Philbin's successor on the show in 2012.

She has been hosting the show since Strahan's exit with guest hosts including her husband Mark Consuelos, close friends Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen, and Pennsylvania high school teacher Richard Curtis, who won the Live co-hot search.

Megyn Kelly also stopped by the day after the election in a rare early appearance for the primetime news host that came just two months before it was revealed she had signed a new contract with NBC where she will have her own morning show.",0
118,"Kim Kardashian ‘Hurt’ By Awkward Exchange With Beyonce — She Wants ‘To Be Friends’ Kim Kardashian would “love to be friends” with Beyonce (who wouldn’t?!) but it seems the feeling is one-sided. HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE details on how Kim really feels about her tense relationship with the singer.

If we made a list of celebrities we wanted to be friends with, Beyoncé would probably take the top spot. But we obviously can’t all be close with the 36-year-old goddess — not even high-profile celebrities like Kim Kardashian, 37, can get into her inner circle. In fact, even though their husbands JAY-Z, 47, and Kanye West, 40, have a feud going on between them, Kim apparently still feels pretty upset that the singer won’t give her the time of day.

“Kim would love to be friends with Beyoncé, she’s never had a problem with her, in fact she’s always looked up to her and thinks she is amazing,” a source close to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “Kim’s really hurt by the way Beyoncé has treated her, even before Kanye and Jay fell out Beyoncé was always cold towards her, and Kim can’t work out why. She went out of her way to be nice to Beyoncé and she really wanted to be friends, but it was clear that Beyoncé didn’t feel the same way.” Ouch?!

It’s not just Kim’s lack of relationship with Bey that upsets her though — it’s also the missed opportunity of bringing together their young daughters North West, 4, and Blue Ivy, 5. “North and Blue Ivy are similar ages and Kim always hoped that they could be playmates, but Beyoncé had no intention of that happening, and has always held both Kim and her daughter at arms length,” the source continued. TBH, a friendship between the two girls would be super cute, but we’re not going to question Bey’s judgement on who her child should hang out with.

One of the “cold” exchanges between Beyoncé and the reality TV star was at their mutual friend Serena Williams‘ wedding on Nov. 16. It was the first time these two came face-to-face since Kanye called out the Lemonade star and her husband during a concert in Nov. 2016. Even if Beyoncé didn’t vibe with Kim before, she most certainly hasn’t since Kim’s husband dissed her and upset her husband. Sorry Kim, but friendship might be permanently off the table.

The first song of the show — “Hollaback Girl” — featured her dancers carrying oversized bananas.

During other songs, such as “Simple Kind of Life,” Stefani wore a makeshift wedding dress, and she harkened back to her ska roots with “Sunday Morning,” donning a midriff-bearing shirt and plaid pants.

Stefani wasn’t afraid to incorporate her love life into the show either. In fact, she seemed to pay homage to boyfriend Blake Shelton as she dressed in a cowgirl outfit for “Make Me Like You,” a song she’s said is about her beau.

Shelton, as expected, was in attendance, even getting a standing ovation when he walked into the theater before settling in with Stefani’s 4-year-old son Apollo in his lap.

“I see a lot of admiring eyes on my sparkles. I know, it’s ridiculous,” Stefani said. “You don’t know what it’s like to wear a cowgirl costume right in front of Blake Shelton. It’s like my fantasy come true.”

After all the costume changes and the hits, the show at its core was, pardon the pun, a sweet escape. But, not only did Stefani give fans a musical trip down memory lane, but she gave her fans a deep dive into her personal life.

During an interlude, Stefani spoke of her younger self, saying she envisioned herself with several kids and a “perfect family.”

“That’s something I dreamed of for a long time,” she said in a video during the show. “But, my own love life experience wasn’t what I thought it would be, and I feel like I had so much love to give inside me, but I was unlucky in love, which has been a blessing because I’ve been able to write about that and share that and have this incredibly blessed musical career.”

She continued, “There was a point in my life where I felt that I was losing everything … When I look back at all the times my heart was broken, it was always music that healed me.”

Before the show even started, Stefani got a loving confidence boost from her man, as he tweeted his well-wishes and sent a bouquet of flowers to her dressing room.

121,"What’s Going on With Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s Divorce? Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Photo: Getty Images

Two years ago, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie dropped a bombshell: the Hollywood power couple was splitting up after two years of marriage but roughly 12 years together. What followed were months of back and forth between the (former) couple in the press. There were leaks about custody battles and Pitt’s reported drinking and weed smoking; meanwhile, Pitt gave a candid interview with GQ about the split and his new passion for sculpture and R&B music.

Last summer, there were a slew of new stories, court filings, and suspicious tabloid take-downs in this seemingly never-ending saga. But on Friday, a judge reportedly declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single – though their divorce settlement has not yet been finalized.

Here, a look at all that has happened with Brangelina’s divorce.

First, can we look back at their … uh … happier … days?

Sure. The coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is already Hollywood legend. The pair met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2004 — back when Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston. Rumors about what may or may not have gone down between Pitt and Jolie on set ran rampant. Eventually, he and Aniston split up, and his relationship with Jolie (officially) came to light. But despite their, erm, salacious start, Pitt and Jolie proved to be the real deal. They were involved for 12 years, and had six kids and a French vineyard together.

So what went wrong?

Back in September 2016, we learned that an “incident” reportedly went down on a private plane, and that the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services and FBI got involved. That “incident,” which reportedly involved Pitt and son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, is said to be what prompted Jolie to file for divorce. But in an interview with Vanity Fair in 2017, Jolie made it pretty clear she didn’t want to talk on the record about what happened.

Ah, okay. But what’s happened since then?

Well, a lot. Just on the personal front, Pitt is said to have allegedly sobered up in rehab following the divorce announcement. He also was either involved or just friends with MIT professor Neri Oxman for a while (their exact relationship has always been unclear, despite making countless headlines). Jolie, meanwhile, has kept up with her humanitarian work for the United Nations. But divorce-wise, the Pitt and Jolie hadn’t been able to agree on custody or child-support arrangements — which means they’re still technically married.

Awkward. So, what went down last summer?

As I said, Jolie and Pitt just couldn’t seem to come to an understanding over custody or seemingly anything else tied to their split. The kids had been living in London as Jolie filmed in the U.K., though Pitt is still based in Los Angeles. Back in June, a judge established a schedule for Pitt to spend time with the kids (other than Maddox, who at 16 the court determined was old enough to decide if he wanted to see his dad or not). As a result, Jolie and the kids returned to Los Angeles.

Then, over the summer of 2018, there were a ton of new stories about the couple. It was nearly impossible to keep all these threads straight, so we organized them for you in handy lists:

Jolie’s lawyer drama:

• In early August 2018, TMZ cited a “source connected to Brad” in reporting that Jolie has been so “hostile” in the divorce proceedings that her allegedly fed-up attorney — celebrity divorce lawyer Laura Wasser — is quitting.

• Then, Jolie’s spokesperson denied TMZ’s report to People, saying Wasser is not quitting “now or in the future. But an “insider” did say the divorce was “entering a new phase.”

• By late August, Jolie confirmed that she was parting ways with Wasser. A spokesperson for Jolie, Mindy Nyby, told People in a statement: “Angelina has decided to change counsel to Samantha Bley Dejean, as Samantha’s expertise is the protection and best interest of children.” Then, a “source” told People that Jolie picked the new attorney as the lead counsel in the case “a month ago.”

The back-and-forth about Pitt’s child support payments:

• In legal documents filed on August 7, Jolie’s attorney claimed “Pitt has paid no meaningful child support since separation.” Jolie also asked the court to order Pitt to pay her the money she is owed, CNN reports.

• But that same day, a “source” told People that Pitt has actually paid “easily millions” toward child support since the 2016 split.

• Around that same time, documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Pitt said that he has paid more than $1.3 in “bills” for the children and loaned Jolie $8 million — and he wants to collect interest on the loan.

• Jolie countered that a loan “is not child support.”

And of course, the petty tabloid stories:

A constant in the battle between Jolie and Pitt were the seemingly never-ending tabloid stories attacking one party at a time. Here are a select few:

• “Page Six” reported on August 7 that a “source” close to Pitt slammed Jolie’s child support filing as a “publicity stunt.”

• On August 15, Us Weekly had an “exclusive” on how Jolie is attacking Pitt because she knows joint custody is a “done deal.” The story paints Pitt as the victim.

• “Page Six” had a bizarre story on August 20 about how Jolie is jealous of Amal Clooney. It also says that the Clooneys have taken Pitt’s side in the divorce battle. Hmmm …

• A “source” told Entertainment Tonight on August 23 that Pitt is “sickened” that Jolie is letting their custody battle be aired in public.

• Again, “Page Six” went for Jolie on August 25 — with a story about how she is not the “saint” she appears to be. Lainey Gossip points out that by now, it’s clear how these stories about Jolie keep getting out.

Luckily, they eventually reportedly reached a “truce,” which sounds nice.

Entertainment Tonight reported in September that Jolie and Pitt had a reached a “truce.” A “source” told ET: “Brad and Angelina actually set up a secret meeting at her house. It’s the first time they have truly gotten together to make things work since their group therapy with the children. Brad and Angie’s meeting was a success. They are going to stay with the plan set forth through the courts.” This reportedly means that they are going to “create a calmer situation for the kids.” Good.

Then, they headed to court in early December.

According to TMZ, a custody hearing date has finally been set for Pitt and Jolie in early December in California. The former pair have reportedly filed docs asking a judge to give them until June to sort out the final details of their divorce (with the use of a private judge, who will also help them figure out the division of property), but on December 4, their custody trial is set to start. TMZ notes that Jolie still wants sole custody, while Pitt wants joint custody of their children. The trial will reportedly take two to three weeks.

And now, they’re both legally single (though not yet technically divorced).

E! News reports that as of Friday, a judge has declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single. The judge issued a bifurcated judgment, according to The Blast, which means that their marriage is essentially over, even though they are still finalizing their divorce settlement and custody agreement.

122,"Is Jennifer Lopez engaged to Alex Rodriguez, when did she start dating the baseball star and who have they previously gone out with? JENNIFER Lopez is set to walk down the aisle for the FOURTH time.

Here's the lowdown on her romance with Alex Rodriguez.

Getty - Contributor 3 Jennifer Lopez has announced that she’s engaged to her baseball legend boyfriend Alex Rodriguez

Is Jennifer Lopez engaged to Alex Rodriguez?

In March 2019 it was revealed that Jennifer Lopez had got engaged to her baseball legend boyfriend Alex Rodriguez during a romantic beach getaway.

The three-times married singer, 49, announced the news by posting a pic of her massive diamond sparkler on Instagram with a number of heart emojis.

Before the announcement, in July 2018 Jen sparked rumours she was engaged to Alex after sporting a Cartier ring on her wedding finger.

The pair also sent the rumour mill in full motion when they were spotted buying jewellery on Valentine's Day 2018.

AP.ASSOCIATED PRESS 3 The pair has been dating since 2017

When did she start dating the baseball star?

Jennifer first started dating A-Rod in March 2017 after first meeting him in 2005 at a baseball game she had attended with her then-husband Marc Anthony.

They confirmed their romance when they were spotted out wearing matching outfits and they made their red carpet debut at the 2017 Met Gala.

Earlier this year the couple bought their first home together after they snapped up a £10million New York apartment.

Jen revealed she believes men are 'useless' before they turn 33 so it's a good sign that the baseball legend is over the required age limit that saw her linked to 31-year-old Drake and then 24-year-old Casper Smart.

Allison Williams may play the unlucky in love character Marnie on HBO's Girls, but it appears that in real life she couldn't be happier. It was announced last week that Williams was set to wed her boyfriend, Ricky Van Veen, and now we've gotten a closer look at her dazzling engagement ring! The actress flashed her diamond sparkler for the first time at Sunday's Vanity Fair Oscar party, making for a major red carpet moment.

Williams' cushion-cut ring is seriously stunning—and massive—and appears to be flanked by multiple diamonds on each side. The classic rock suits her pretty style, and we think Van Veen made the perfect choice. The actress met her fiancé, who co-founded CollegeHumor, through mutual friends, and the pair have been together for three years. Given our love for her style, we can’t wait to see what the star will choose to wear when she walks down the aisle.

So it’s fitting that in the wake of the news of Hugh Hefner‘s death, everyone from celebrities to politicians to former Playboy cover models are taking to social media to pay tribute to Hefner and honor his legacy.

There were those who recognized the good he did in the world, like Rev. Jesse Jackson who praised Hefner for being “a strong supporter of the civil rights movement.”

“Hugh Hefner was a GIANT in publishing, journalism, free speech & civil rights. He was a true original, and he was my friend,” wrote Larry King. “Rest well Hef.”

“Few did more for writers, inc myself, breaking boundaries and helping Lenny fight for his 1st Amend Rights,” said Richard Lewis.

A rep for the Playboy Enterprises founder confirmed the tragic news in a statement to PEOPLE: “Hugh M. Hefner, the American icon who in 1953 introduced the world to Playboy magazine and built the company into one of the most recognizable American global brands in history, peacefully passed away today from natural causes at his home, The Playboy Mansion, surrounded by loved ones.”

Hefner’s son Cooper, who is also the Chief Creative Officer of Playboy Enterprises, also released a statement.

“My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom. He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history. He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises,” said Cooper.

127,"Jennifer Aniston’s short marriage to Justin Theroux is over Click here if you are having a problem viewing the photos or video on a mobile device

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, one of Hollywood’s most glamorous super couples, have split after just two and a half years of marriage, the Associated Press is reporting.

The two, who had been together as a couple for seven years, had been spending quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their Los Angeles home, People reported.

The couple issued a statement through Aniston’s longtime publicist, saying that the decision to separate “was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year,” Page Six reported.

The couple also said they were making the announcement publicly, “in an effort to reduce any further speculation.”

“Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” the statement read. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”

The “Friends” star, 49, and Theroux, 46, a screenwriter and actor lauded for his performance in HBO’s “The Leftovers,” were engaged in August of 2012. They married in August 2015 in an intimate but star-studded in the garden of their $21 million minimalist estate in Bel-Air. Jimmy Kimmel officiated, according to Harpers Bazaar.

Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. As she and Pitt were breaking up, Pitt’s romance with Angelina Jolie became public.

The announcement that Aniston and Theroux are done comes just a few days after the actress celebrated her 49th birthday Sunday in Malibu with girlfriends, including Courtney Cox. Theroux, meanwhile, was across the country for New York fashion week, Us Weekly reported.

Sources recently told People that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.

“Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source People. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”

But Aniston told a story of marital bliss in a conversation with actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, published in September in Harper’s Bazaar. The two shared happy memories of Aniston’s wedding to Theroux. Sedaris, who is a good friend of Theroux’, served as his “best man.”

“Everything about that wedding was perfect,” Sedaris said. “Everyone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy.”

Aniston said it was “fun” to revisit a video of the wedding Theroux had just given her.

But the actress, who has a passion for interior design, also talked about the challenges of working together on updating their Bel-Air mansion, which is featured on the March cover of Architectural Digest.

“They say building houses can make or break a couple,” Aniston said. “I was so used to doing it on my own, and there were moments when I was like, ‘Don’t say no so fast.’ I have this dialogue with my interior designer where I’ll go: ‘No. Hate it. Move. Next.’ That can sound a little abrupt, so I had to retool my attitude a bit. It wasn’t very hard because he loved whatever I brought to him.”",0

{""position1"": {""catalog_type"": ""station"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 4429, ""name"": ""The Beat"", ""station"": {""call_letters"": ""IURB-FL"", ""countries"": ""US"", ""description"": ""Hip Hop, R\u0026B and Back in the Day Joints"", ""id"": 4429, ""name"": ""The Beat""}, ""stations"": [{""call_letters"": ""IURB-FL"", ""countries"": ""US"", ""description"": ""Hip Hop, R\u0026B and Back in the Day Joints"", ""id"": 4429, ""name"": ""The Beat""}], ""type"": ""catalog""}}

Of course, nothing was “finished” between the committed spouses. And so, after the 2016 election last November, the National Enquirer tried again, this time with a report announcing, “Obamas To Split After White House Exit!” The gossip magazine actually maintained divorce lawyers were already “hammering out a deal so the presidential pair can end their 24-year union as soon as they leave the White House!” At issue, claimed the tabloid, was “child support, custody, and their $25 million fortune,” As Gossip Cop rightly said at the time, though, the allegations were total bullsplit.

The Obamas left office in January and immediately went on a joint vacation. In the time since, they’ve made no move towards a divorce. Yet Radar Online decided to revive the split narrative this past July, suggesting there were “marriage problems” because the former president was “spotted smiling without his wedding band.” It was sensationalized drivel that was spun simply because Barack posed for a photo in an airport. It was followed, however, by another story claiming Barack wanted to “cut loose and party” and had secret plans to “live life as a bachelor without Michelle” amid “divorce rumors.”

Those manufactured “divorce rumors,” however, had no merit and only came from the webloid and its print counterpart. But according to this tale, the ex commander-in-chief had “kicked wife Michelle to the curb” and wanted to “enjoy all the lovely young women” around him. It was even alleged they “secretly agreed to a $25 million divorce deal,” and a purported “insider” was quoted as saying, “Their marriage is through. The wedding band is gone — and Michelle will soon follow!” So, what really followed those contentions?

Well, the Obamas remained together, just as Gossip Cop said they would. And today, they mark a quarter of century united in marriage. Gossip Cop sincerely wishes the couple a rumor-free anniversary, and we’ll be here to correct any continued misinformation as necessary.

130,"Miranda Kerr Is Pregnant Again! Congratulations are in order for Miranda Kerr. The supermodel announced on Wednesday, November 15, that she is expecting a baby with her husband of six months, Evan Spiegel.

This will be the second child for the 34-year-old, who shares custody of son, Flynn, 6, with her ex-husband, Orlando Bloom.

“Miranda, Evan and Flynn are looking forward to welcoming the newest member of their family,” a spokesperson tells Us Weekly.

Beauty DNA: Five Secrets of Miranda Kerr’s Feminine Style

Kerr and the Snapchat founder, 27, were married at their home in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood on May 27. They couple announced their engagement in July 2016 when she shared a photo of her diamond ring alongside a custom “Marry Me” Snapchat filter. “I said yes!!!” wrote the former Victoria’s Secret Angel on Instagram.

Despite the age difference between the spouses, Kerr has gushed about Spiegel’s maturity. “He’s not out partying. He goes to work in [L.A.’s] Venice,” she told The Edit in 2016. “He comes home early. We don’t go out. We’d rather be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.”

Kerr once said that parenting Flynn is “the most rewarding thing” she’s ever done. “It has taught me so much about patience and unconditional love,” she told Harper’s Bazaar. “Being a working mother is challenging because . . . I never want to leave him — but it’s important to teach your child the value of working.”

131,"Why Meghan Markle ‘TAMED’ Prince Harry more than Cressida and Chelsy ever could Meghan Markle, 36, will marry Prince Harry, 33, in a royal wedding ceremony on May 19 2018, and it seems the royal’s wife-to-be stands out from his previous girlfriends in one particular way.

It is known Prince Harry had high profile relationships with Chelsy Davy, 32, and Cressida Bonas, 29, before he began dating Meghan in 2016.

However, a royal expert has said no previous romantic interest had ever “tamed” Harry in the way that Meghan has done.

“I think Meghan has had a really positive influence on Harry,” Katie Nicholl, author of Harry Life Loss and Love told Express.co.uk exclusively.

“Historically Harry has always been ‘tamed’ by his girlfriends, we saw that with Chelsy and Cressida, but I think Meghan’s had a bigger influence on him than any other woman.”",0
132,"Is Travis Scott Finally On His ‘Way Home’ To Kylie Jenner After Missing Christmas? Travis Scott is coming home to Calabasas… maybe! After apparently missing this year’s Kardashian Christmas, where his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner was, is Trav about to reunite with his girl? See this mysterious photo…

Christmas may have came late for Travis Scott, 25, and Kylie Jenner, 20. After he’s been traveling all over, playing shows for packed crowds, the rapper is finally headed “home,” wherever that may be. Travis took to Snapchat on December 27, to show his followers — and most likely, Kylie Jenner — that he had boarded a private plane and will “make it home to ya one way or another.” So, who really was his caption directed at? — Our guess is his reported pregnant girlfriend, who was seemingly without her baby daddy on Christmas. While some reports claim Travis was present at Kris Jenner‘s annual Christmas eve party, he was nowhere to be found in photos; Yet, Kylie, who has been M.I.A., since the news of her pregnancy broke, was surprisingly photographed.

The stars came out for the momager’s annual bash, but, Travis wasn’t seen, as far as we know. However, Khloe Kardashian, 33, who proudly showed off her growing baby bump in a beaded jumpsuit, and the rest of the K-fam danced the night away to Travis’ tracks. Khloe even posed for photos, rubbing her belly, which has a few more months to grow; Khloe is six months along as of December 2017. What really shocked fans, was when Kylie emerged for a shoot in the black and white photo booth with Khloe; A signature Kardashian-Jenner party staple. Although it was great to see Kylie at the party, she only posed for photos from the chest-up, as she is still keeping her pregnancy under wraps.

The status of Kylie and Trav’s relationship is unknown these days, as both stars have remained quiet about their future first child together, a baby girl, according to reports. Fans were even worried when he was photographed at a Hollywood strip club with friends on December 22.

Here’s what we know about Kylie’s pregnancy, so far. — Fans of the lip kit mogul believe she’s been hinting at the baby’s gender for months with social media posts containing the color pink; like her pink Christmas tree, nail color and more subtle pink objects she’s posted. And, speaking of social media, the queen of Instagram, has significantly downplayed her social use since the baby news broke. Kylie has also been posing from the chest up in new photos, as well as posting old photos of herself. Not to mention, she’s has yet to appear in this season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Her exact due date is unknown, but it’s been reported she may have the baby in early 2018, around February or March. Kylie and Travis, as well as the Kardashian family have yet to confirm the baby news.

134,"Kendall Jenner’s Instagram Comment About Scott Disick & Sofia Richie Is So Shady There is never a shortage of drama in the Kardashian-Jenner family. Given that there are so many immediate and extended family members, there is always something going on that piques public interest. One of the latest intriguing happenings involves Scott Disick and his girlfriend, Sofia Richie. While the family isn't known for publicly commenting on such high-profile situations, Kendall Jenner's Instagram comment about Scott Disick and Sofia Richie seemingly displayed her true (and not-so-positive) feelings about the couple.

Jenner reportedly commented on a photo of Disick with Richie and his three kids (whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend, and Jenner's sister, Kourtney Kardashian) that surfaced on an Instagram fan account called @scottthelord. From screenshots grabbed of the apparently now-deleted comment, it appears that Jenner (on her verified account) wrote, ""Awww, Scott and his kids,"" and then she closed the comment with a laughing emoji, according to Teen Vogue. Elite Daily reached out to Kendall Jenner's representation for comment but has not heard back at the time of publication.

Eagle-eyed fans immediately noticed the presumable shady comment before it was deleted. Why would a seemingly innocent comment like that be considered shady? Well, Jenner could either really be swooning over Disick spending time with his three kids: Mason, Penelope, and Reign, or she could be lumping Richie in as one of the ""kids"" as a dig at the couple's 15-year age difference — Disick is 34 years old and Richie is 19.

It seems like fans ran away with the latter theory since this appears to the be the first time that Jenner has publicly commented on the relationship between Disick and Richie, which was rumored to have begun back in September 2017. Once fans decided that the reported comment was meant to be shady, there was a multitude of responses.

Some fans were loving Jenner's tongue-in-cheek comment, and they responded positively with messages like, ""Love that @kendalljenner is just subtly throwing shade at Scott and Sofia haha,"" and ""Yasssss savage."" While there were definitely many fans that were very much here for Jenner's comment, there were just as many people who were ready serve some shade right back at her.

A common thread in those responses including reminding Jenner that her sister, Kylie Jenner, was 17 years old when she reportedly began dating then-boyfriend Tyga in 2014, according to Cosmopolitan. With that in their arsenal, people replied with comments like, ""Didn't your sister Kylie date Tyga when she was 17? What about your sister Kourtney and your mom? LOL just stop."" Beyond Kylie's previous relationship, people also pointed out that a couple other members of Kendall's family have younger significant others as well.

Kourtney Kardashian (who will turn 39 years old in April) has been spotted globetrotting with her 24-year-old boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, since they began dating back in December 2016. And even the matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner crew, Kris Jenner, is dating someone 25 years her junior. In the end, though, everyone involved — from Richie and Disick to Kourtney and Kris and their respective boyfriends — is over the age of 18, which means they are all legally adults and can make their own decisions about who they want to date.

Of course, the drama rears its head because the relationship between exes, Kardashian and Disick, does not always appear amicable. While it seems like they do their best to co-parent and get along for the sake of their children, there is no doubt that it appears difficult for both parties to always keep on a happy face in this situation.

And when it comes to being a ride-or-die sister, Kendall is definitely there for Kourt with her latest comment. If you are familiar with Keeping Up With The Kardashians, though, you know the family has a somewhat biting sense of humor, so let's just hope that Disick and Richie are in on this (possible) joke.",0

And it appears that Charlize Theron and Alexander Skarsgard have rekindled their relationship nearly six years after first dating, according to Life & Style.

Charlize, 42, and Alexander, 41, are trying to keep things 'private' but have reportedly been 'flirting on set' of their new film, political comedy Flarsky.

Alexander Skarsgard has rekindled his relationship with Charlize Theron nearly six years after first dating, according to Life & Style; seen in January

'They're keeping it as private as they can, but it's hard to hide,' an insider revealed. 'They are both thrilled that this romance is back on.'

The power couple were first rumored to be dating back in 2012, but their short romance ended after 'just a few dates' with each going their separate ways.

'The first time they laid eyes on each other all those years ago, there was an attraction,' the source said. 'They've stayed in touch since the first go-round,' the insider noted before adding that Skarsgard has met her adopted kids, Jackson, six, and August, two.

She has stayed single since her 2015 break up with Sean Penn,57, while Skarsgard and ex Alexa Chung, 34, split last summer.

'Charlize is a woman who knows what she wants and just goes for it,' the insider said. 'She did it with Alexander back then, and now she's done it again.'

Skarsgard and Theron are known to avoid the Hollywood scene and feel a bit like 'outsiders' in the industry.

'They're both straight shooters,' the source said. 'Charlize cusses and has a wicked sense of humor, which he loves. 'Alexander is a serious guy, a deep thinker, and she loves that. He's well-read, loves the classics and is a movie buff just like her.'

As they take their time diving into their newfound relationship, Charlize is always making sure she makes the right moves.

'Charlize is usually very skittish about becoming serious with anyone, but she is also an intense, take-no-prisoners woman,' the insider revealed. 'Needless to say, she takes everything she does seriously.'",0
136,"The Women of Hollywood Speak Out Studio heads may have no choice but to listen. As Kathleen Kennedy told me: ‘‘I had an agent pitching directors to me recently, and when he got done, I waited, and then I said, ‘So, do you represent any women?’ He said, ‘Oh, mmmmm.’ I had to bring it up. I think you’ve got to put pressure on them.’’ Tom Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures, recently told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘‘There’s a myth in the business that young males drive the box office. Maybe a decade ago or so that was true. I don’t find that true now at all. I actually think women drive the box office.’’ For the moment, it seems the bandwagon is rolling. ‘‘All of a sudden, we’re in this era of, ‘Oh, my God, girls,’ ’’ Pascal told me. ‘‘It’ll last about as long as it always does: about five more minutes.’’

Soloway has become a gleeful militant with a ‘‘messianic, feminist, patriarchy-toppling dream.’’ The mother of two sons, one a 7-year-old, she wants to put a nursery on her set and has been lobbying the D.G.A. to allow two directors per episode for more flex time.

The kids question is a significant one. Several top executives talk about the problem of female directors dropping out to have families. And there is still such an atmosphere of fear that many female directors told me they hide their pregnancies until the last possible minute. One director confessed that she actually hides her child, refusing to put a photo of her son on Facebook, fearing ‘‘it could end my career.’’

‘‘I’ve even had women executives say to me, not realizing I was a mom, ‘We always want to work with women filmmakers, but then they have kids,’ ’’ says Marielle Heller, who also directed last summer’s critically acclaimed ‘‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl.’’ ‘‘It’s a real stigma, which I think is not fair. It’s crazy to me that that’s the excuse because nobody ever asks men who have kids whether they’ll be able to do it.’’

Over lemonade at Le Pain Quotidien on Melrose Avenue, Gina Prince-Bythewood, in gilt Wonder Woman kicks, said that when she was shooting ‘‘The Secret Life of Bees’’ in North Carolina, her husband back in L.A. told her that her younger son, now 11, was walking around the house with a toy phone having a pretend conversation with her. ‘‘I had a lot of guilt; it wrecked me,’’ said the 46-year-old, who also has a 14-year-old son. ‘‘But I’m a director, and I need to feed that part of me.’’

For nearly six months now, I’ve had the voices of Prince-Bythewood and many other talented women echoing in my head. I hear them puzzling about the disparity problem and dissecting it, trying to find a way around it or plotting to go head-on against it. Dunham talks about quotas. Others pin their hopes on web disruption with new studios at Netflix and Amazon.

But, as Prince-Bythewood says, the studios should open the door for women who are in love with film and with storytelling. ‘‘Just get us in the room,’’ she says.",0
137,"Brad Pitt & Co-Star Margot Robbie: Is She Crushing On Him Too? The Truth Does Margot Robbie reciprocate co-star Brad Pitt’s rumored feelings for her? We’ll explain what’s really going on between these two!

Sorry, this won’t be a Mr. & Mrs. Smith situation. Margot Robbie, 28, has eyes for one man, and it’s not for her co-star Brad Pitt, 54! The two actors began filming for Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time In Hollywood earlier this summer, and rumors sprung that Brad had the hots for Margot. While that’s yet to be confirmed, we can confirm this: Margot is respecting her wedding vows! “Margot is madly in love with her husband Tom,” a friend of Margot’s shares EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife. Just a reminder — Margot wedded Tom Ackerley, 28, the producer for her film I, Tonya, on December 18, 2016! “Even if Brad tried, he would never be able to woo her away.”

Margot’s admiration for Brad — because really, you can’t help but admire the knockout — is purely professional! “Margot thinks Brad is amazing, hot, sexy, really talented and she has the utmost respect for him, but there’s absolutely no crush on her part,” the Suicide Squad‘s friend adds. “She’s only got eyes for Tom. Margot thinks her husband is the best looking guy on the planet, even Brad Pitt can’t compete with Tom, at least not for Margot.” Yup, you heard that right — not even Brad Pitt! Well, we hope Tom can relax after hearing those kind words. As we’ve told you, Margot’s husband has reportedly been wary of Brad, supposedly dropping by onset of Once Upon a Time In Hollywood and “keeping a close eye on Brad,” a source close to Margot and Tom claimed to Life & Style in its Aug. 29 issue.

How did this rumored love triangle mess even start? Well, Brad was reportedly “smitten” with Margot, another Life & Style source claimed, which we reported on July 26. The source went so far as to claim that the actors’ other co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, “has called [Brad] out for layering it on so thick [with Margot].” None of this has been confirmed, and Brad could just be a happy (almost legal) bachelor minding his own business! He does have an ongoing custody battle with his soon-to-be ex-wife Angelina Jolie, 43, to worry about.",0

Rumours: The 20-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, who is yet to publicly confirm her baby news, attended her mum Kris Jenner's annual Christmas Eve bash with her rapper beau yet just days later US sources have claimed they have broken up

Kylie was first hit with widespread speculation that she is expecting Travis' child in September yet since then she has remained uncharacteristically coy on both social media and in the glare of the public eye.

Kylie and Travis began dating in April - in the weeks following her split from ex-beau Tyga. After months of questions over the state of their relationship, the couple's pictures together at Kris' party seemed to indicate they are very much together.

Just six days later, sources have claimed the couple have parted ways after Travis ended the romance - while vowing to always be there for the tot.

Insiders said: 'He finally plucked up the courage to tell Kylie he’s done, that he loves her and will always be around for the baby, but they’re not compatible as a couple. Kylie was totally blindsided even though everyone else in her life saw this coming.

'She’s still refusing to admit it’s over, and begging him to stick around.'

I am so thankful, excited, nervous, eager, overjoyed and scared all in one! But it's the best bundle of feelings I've ever felt in my life!'

People LOVE when couples rekindle their romances, but is a reunion in the cards for Kristen Stewart, 27, and Robert Pattinson, 31? The Twilight alums were spotted “hanging out” together on Feb. 11, and we’re hearing that the former couple are on good terms now! “It’s taken a long time to get there, but Rob and Kristen are finally friends again,” a source close to Rob told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Their break-up was so painful for Rob, and he felt so angry and humiliated by Kristen cheating, that at one point he doubted he would ever be able to fully forgive her. But, time heals and Rob’s now managed to put the past behind him and let bygones be bygones.”

But even though the pair have a past with each other, don’t expect them them to be getting together in the future. “Rob and Kristen have so much shared history, they were together during the craziest time in their lives, they pretty much grew up together during the whole Twilight madness, and they really understand each other better than anyone else could. Rob still has a lot of love and respect for Kristen, but it’s evolved from romantic feelings into a deep friendship,” the insider added.

If you’re bummed that Bella and Edward won’t be living the rest of eternity together IRL, listen, I get it. We all are gunning for our faves to rekindle their lost love. Personally, I’m still not over the fact that Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron broke up! But, unfortunately, not every couple is Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. And also, Kristen herself has said in a monologue on Saturday Night Live that she is “like so gay dude.” She’s currently dating Victoria’s Secret model Stella Maxwell, 27. So yeah, Kristen and Robert aren’t getting back together any time soon, and that’s probably for the best. (And while we’re at it, quit it with the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston shipping! They’re not getting back together! Stop it!)

Is Kaley Cuoco pregnant?

There are rumors that ""The Big Bang Theory"" actress is getting ready to start a family with her husband, Ryan Sweeting. The couple has just bought Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom's former home in Tarzana, California, and according to reports, they have converted what used to be Odom's man cave into a nursery.

Though Cuoco is not pregnant as of the moment, fans of the actress are supporting her if ever she does decide to have a baby anytime soon. For now, Cuoco is busy filming the eighth season of ""The Big Bang Theory"" and caring for her dogs. The actress is also a known advocate for animal rights and adoption of rescue dogs, and she has been seen frequenting events which support those causes.

Recently, the actress made headlines when she successfully secured a new contract for the show, with the actress now set to earn $1 million per episode. Her cast mates Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons were also able to negotiate their contracts for the same amount of money.

Though she's now one of the highest paid actresses on television, she appears to still enjoy going out and about on her usual activities. On Monday, Cuoco was seen in a flowing pink maxi dress while leaving her yoga class in Los Angeles. She was seen carrying three bags, a rolled-up yoga mat, and a lime green water bottle. Her hair, which is cut in a pixie style, appeared to be slightly damp after her workout.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she explained the need for her drastic makeover as the actress is known for her flowing blonde locks.

""I talked to the producers [of Big Bang Theory], I have this idea to cut my hair and I cut it really short but it was for a movie over the summer,"" said Cuoco. ""I had a talk with the writers who loved it and they were great about it and they said 'I think it will be a great change for Penny and the show.' They were really cool about it and on my side when they wrote it in, so I got lucky!""",0

142,"Would you spend $30K to look like Ivanka Trump? CLOSE Women are showing up at their plastic surgeon’s office saying I want to look like her. The picture on their phone? It’s Ivanka Trump. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60

When a woman shows a celebrity picture to her plastic surgeon and says, ""I want to look like her!"" the face glowing on her phone might be Jennifer Lopez, Kim Kardashian, Angelina Jolie or Scarlett Johansson. And now, say some surgeons, the new star is Ivanka Trump.

""In my practice, Ivanka is sort of the new style icon for plastic surgery,"" says Houston surgeon Franklin Rose, who says he's already performed extensive work on ""several"" women who wanted to look more like President Trump's elder daughter.

And why not? ""I think she's exquisite,"" Rose says.

So does one of his patients, Jenny Stewart, 37, who last summer underwent more than six hours of surgery by Rose to reshape her nose and augment her breasts. She got liposuction to harvest fat to lift her buttocks, and she got injectable fillers for her face. All of it cost about $30,000, a discount because Stewart agreed to do interviews with reporters.

(People magazine profiled another of Rose's Texas patients, Tiffany Taylor, who spent $60,000 to look like Ivanka.)

""At first, the healing process was painful ... but after that I'm absolutely happy with the results,"" Stewart says.

Stewart had seen Ivanka in the media before the election but hadn't really thought of her as a model for enhancing her own appearance, which already was attractive. But she took notice when Donald Trump started to run for president and Ivanka, 35 and previously best known in New York, suddenly was all over global news feeds.

CLOSE Plastic surgery is becoming more and more mainstream, but should be considered seriously. USA TODAY

""I was very much interested in the election, and that’s when I started thinking she was pretty,"" says Stewart, a mother of two and an IT headhunter consultant who lives in Houston and Los Angeles. She Googled images of Ivanka and picked three she thought exhibited the features she admired and wanted to enhance on herself: Ivanka's small nose, the way her breasts fit her frame, and her rounded cheeks.

""I thought Ivanka was classically pretty and not overdone,"" she says. ""I had always admired her appearance, but then I started seeing her more often in the media. She was right there and still is. I follow her on Instagram and Facebook and I see her in my news feed.""

Jenny Stewart, after plastic surgery by Houston surgeon Franklin Rose to enhance her appearance so she looks more like Ivanka Trump. (Photo: Jenny Stewart)

Oh, and politics had nothing to do with it, she says: She voted for Hillary Clinton.

In the old days, Rose says, patients would come in with pictures from magazines — say, Playboy — and now they come in with pictures on their cellphones. In recent years, patients would say they want buttocks like Lopez's or Kardashian's, breasts like Johansson's or lips like Jolie's.

Now, Ivanka has reached movie star-level celebrity — more visible than her stepmother, ex-model-turned-first lady Melania Trump — thanks to her steady presence on the campaign trail, her carefully curated Instagram page, and as an unofficial adviser to dad at the White House.

""In the last year and a half, I've seen several patients who came in with pictures of Ivanka,"" Rose says. ""The Ivanka thing is very widespread, at least in Texas.""

Rod Rohrich, a plastic surgeon in Dallas and professor of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern, agrees.

""Yes, absolutely, I have had a lot of patients in the past six months or more who ask about Ivanka’s great and sculpted, clean facial features, including her high cheekbones and beautiful skin and elegant nose,"" says Rohrich. He says she's ""in the top five"" on the list of people that patients cite when they ask for fillers on their cheeks and for rhinoplasty.

""There’s always been an interest in the appearance and the trends of public figures and (Ivanka) has been a good example, because she's a very pretty woman, she's articulate and she has classic features,"" says Alan Matarasso, a leading plastic surgeon in Manhattan, a professor of surgery at Hofstra University Northwell School of Medicine, and a vice president and spokesman for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

""I can't give you any numbers,"" Matarasso adds. ""But the reason is, she’s been in the media a lot, she has classic good looks and is not overdone in any way.""

(Matarasso and other plastic surgeons say it is crucial for would-be patients to consult board-certified surgeons to get appropriate advice, no matter who they want to look like.The ASPS website provides a free service helping to link patients with doctors in their area.)

Sherrell Aston, a professor of plastic surgery at New York University and another prominent Manhattan surgeon with many celebrities for patients, says he's not sure how widespread the Ivanka-wannabe trend might be, but he wouldn't be surprised to learn it's growing.

""I think that across the country, plastic surgeons with aesthetic practices will see people who will mention her by name as being someone they admire and would like to have features that are similar,"" Aston says. ""I don’t think it’s necessarily limited to Houston. (Ivanka) is widespread (in the media) and so is aesthetic surgery, and I think it’s conceivable it could happen anywhere in the country.""

But not everywhere. Surgeon Lyle Leipziger, chief of plastic surgery at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., says his patients don't come in with celebrity pictures — or any pictures.

""In my practice, patients don’t usually come in asking to look like someone else. They want to be a more enhanced version of themselves,"" he says. ""Over the years, there isn’t a patient who hasn’t said, 'I want to look natural.' … The statement (among plastic surgeons) is the best plastic surgery doesn’t leave you looking plastic.""

Nor does he believe most plastic surgeons are seeing an uptick in Ivanka-copying patients.

""I certainly understand that Ivanka Trump is a beautiful, stunning and poised individual, and I can understand how people can identify with her, as people have with many (other celebrities) over the years,"" he says. ""But I don’t know if this is happening elsewhere.""

Nine years ago on Wednesday, the couple tied the knot. And in celebration of their anniversary, DeGeneres, 59, shared a loving tribute to Instagram!

“@PortiadeRossi and I got married 9 years ago today,” the Ellen DeGeneres Show host captioned a smiling, black-and-white photo of the pair on their wedding day. “Being her wife is the greatest thing I am.”

Singer Joshua Radin, who performed at the couple’s wedding, also took to the photo and video-sharing app to celebrate their union.

“Nine years ago today, these two incredible women got married and asked me to sing some of my songs to them while they were celebrating their most special day. It’s still one of the most fun things I’ve ever done,” Radin wrote. “Happy anniversary @theellenshow and @portiaderossi.”

During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, de Rossi recalled about falling for DeGeneres. “We actually met socially and I just felt that immediate draw,” she said. “We did talk a little bit and then over those three years, we saw each other at parties or at various things, but the one time that was the most significant was during a photoshoot actually.”

She continued: “I just walked over to say hello to her, and I couldn’t believe it, but she turned around and it was like an arrow was shot through my heart. I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it.”

In a 2008 episode of her talk show, DeGeneres announced her plans to wed de Rossi; the reveal followed the news that the California Supreme Court had struck down a law banning same-sex marriage. The happy couple later showed off their engagement bling on the Daytime Emmys red carpet that same year.

That August, the couple tied the knot with an intimate ceremony in their L.A. home. (To see more of their cute moments from throughout the years, click here).

“Portia and I constantly say to each other, ‘We are so lucky.’ Sometimes it’s lying in bed at night before I go to sleep, and I just say thank you to whatever, whoever is out there,” DeGeneres told PEOPLE in her 2016 cover story. “I’ve gotten to a place where I really am just settled. Really. I know that I’m not going anywhere. She’s not going anywhere. I’m not saying the relationship took a while; I’m saying in my life, it took a while to find this.”",0

Now that Justin Bieber, 24, and Selena Gomez‘s, 25, “break” has become something pretty permanent looking, we can’t help wondering if the “What Do You Mean?” singer is hoping to find someone new soon? Well, thanks to our insiders, we’re learning how Justin is managing the single life again! “There are plenty of gorgeous girls that would love a chance to date Justin but he’s simply not ready to get serious with anyone,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He’s still reeling from the breakup with Selena, he needs more time to heal.”

The insider added that Justin is just wanting to kick back and enjoy the summer months before taking another chance a romance. “Apparently he’s vowed to stay single for the summer,” the source added. “Who knows if he’ll be able to stick to it but right now that’s the plan. He’s definitely not desperate to fall in love again.” Something tells us the crooner is in for a very fun summer regardless!

As we previously reported, while Justin is trying to find a path forward, Selena is confident ending their romance was the right thing to do. “Selena knows that ending their relationship is for the best, and that to do so they have to cut off contact,” a source previously shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “It’s like ripping off a band aid – you have to go through the pain at first in one go, then it’s okay. Mandy [Teefey, her mother] is being a great source of support to Selena and they’re talking all the time, so that’s providing her with a lot of comfort.”

The insider added that Sel is so self-assured in her decision to end her romance with Justin, she’s prepared to cross paths with him again one day. “Selena hasn’t reached out to Abel [Tesfaye] at all,” they said. “They haven’t spoken since their split, but she genuinely wishes him nothing but the best. She hasn’t spoken to Justin either, as she thinks that’s the best way for them to get over each other. Selena knows it’s inevitable that she and Justin will cross paths, though. They go to the same church, so it’s going to happen, and she is mentally prepared to smile, nod her head and move on.”",0

148,"‘Go buy Ivanka’s stuff,’ Kellyanne Conway said. Then the first daughter’s fashion sales exploded. Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online.

In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes.

That changed dramatically the following month.

Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before.

Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.”

“Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.”

And viewers did, apparently.



Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst)

Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.”

“For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said.

Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.

But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales.

“It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.”

Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.

[Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?]

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported.

The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain.

On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel.

“When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.”

[A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’]

Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products.

According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses.

“We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.”

Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.)

The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers. The collection includes living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers.

The companies attributed their decisions to product performance. Nordstrom, for instance, said sales of the brand have steadily declined, particularly in the last half of 2016.

Still, despite the boycott, Trump’s line of fragrances enjoyed top spots in Amazon’s best-selling list last month, The Post’s Amy B Wang reported. The Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum spray was the top-selling item in the “Perfumes & Fragrances” category.

Now, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the former co-stars used to be ‘friends with benefits’ but Jared wouldn’t commit. Here’s what we know!

It’s hard to imagine a better looking couple than Brangelina, but since Angelina Jolie, 41, and Brad Pitt, 53, are officially over we have to open our minds to seeing her with someone else. And if that someone else is Jared Leto, 45, we’re not mad at it.

We absolutely loved them in Alexander and who could forget Girl, Interrupted. But it tuns out these two shared more than just the screen. “Jared and Angelina had a very casual relationship years and years ago, it was a friends with benefits situation,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com

So, why didn’t they ever get serious? According to our source Jared was just too much of a player. “It might have turned into more but Jared was too noncommittal at the time, he just wasn’t ready to be with one woman, not even Angelina. Then Brad came on the scene and she fell in love and that was that. I know Jared always had regrets about letting her slip away.” Yup, big mistake Jared. Huge.

Luckily for the Suicide Squad hottie he may just be getting another shot with the world’s most beautiful woman. “Jared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in Sep.,” an insider told Star in the magazine’s Feb. 27 issue. “The word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they’ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.” We can totally see these two as a couple.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Jared was a fool for not hanging on to Angelina the first time around? Do you think they’ll get more serious this time? Or will he play her all over again? Let us know in the comments!",0

The Spice Girls have reportedly agreed to a reunion in 2018 which will see them record both a new album and a one-off TV special.

The pop group originally formed in 1994, before splitting in 2000 following the recording of three studio albums. The group reunited for a live tour from 2007-08, while they last performed together at the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.

A new report has claimed that all five original members of The Spice Girls – Mel B, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Mel C and Geri Halliwell – have been taking part in secret talks about the group’s possible return since the summer, with a 2018 date now agreed for a reunion.

“The five of them have been locked in secret talks since the summer, and finally they are all on-board for a 2018 reunion,’ a source told The Sun. “As it stands, they will be working together on a series of projects, which will include an album and a TV special celebrating the Spice Girls.

“Getting Victoria to agree has been a coup for everyone involved, given she has always been the person holding back on a reunion,” the source added.

Things are getting serious between Brad Pitt and his new girlfriend Neri Oxman, and a new report claims that he is ready to introduce her to his six children. Is the couple ready to take the next step in their relationship?

“Brad cannot get enough of her and he thinks the next step is having her meet his children,” claims an insider.

The source also said that Oxman – an MIT professor – “wears the pants in their relationship,” but Pitt doesn’t have a problem with that. The 54-year-old is telling friends that his is in love and his sexual chemistry with Oxman is “off the hook.”

Pitt split with Angelina Jolie back in September 2016 and the two are still trying to reach a settlement in their divorce and a custody agreement for Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, Knox, 9, and Vivienne, 9. Pitt wants to be certain that there are provisions in the custody agreement that will make sure he gets custodial time with all of his kids.

To make things easier on the kids, Jolie bought a house near Pitt’s, but sources say that the actress has been hesitant to make a custody agreement with her ex because he has essentially forced her to settle down in L.A. with their children.

The Ocean’s 11 star decided to rearrange his schedule and take a project in Los Angeles this summer, so he could spend as much time as possible with the Jolie-Pitt brood, and Oxman is traveling back and forth between her home in Massachusetts and his house in California.

The two are still “very much in each other’s lives,” but Pitt would like to see Oxman more. However, she has her own life in Boston, so they will have to settle for long-distance at the moment.

This arrangement may be working for Pitt and Oxman, but some reports claim that Jolie is not happy because she can’t bring the kids with her to London this summer while she films Maleficent 2. Pitt wants the kids in Los Angeles and to see them on the regular custody schedule. He is not okay with them being gone for an extended period of time. He believes it is best for them to stay home.

They continued: ‘They’re considering it, Kim’s kind of on the fence about the idea but Kanye loves it. He thinks North is a creative genius and he’s happy to let her name their third child.’

Kim has previously spoken about the fact that North is already not a fan of her little brother Saint.

154,"Jenna Dewan Says Her Divorce From Channing Tatum Was “a Positive Thing” Since announcing their separation after almost nine years of marriage in April, dancer and World of Dance judge Jenna Dewan and actor Channing Tatum have remained relatively mum on details of their divorce. But in a new cover story for Women’s Health, Dewan opened up on life post-Tatum, where she talked finding personal growth in a time of intense scrutiny.

“I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Dewan told the magazine. “It’s always challenging to go through a big change and have the whole world have an opinion about it. . . It’s okay for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much—that it can be a positive thing. That was ultimately what happened with us.”

Dewan said the mutual separation was a positive decision, and that it felt right for the family as a whole. (She and Tatum have a five-year-old daughter, Everly). “It’s been a journey, and it’s been a transformation of myself—my needs and wants as a woman,” she said. “I think everyone wants to hold on to what’s in front of them, but when you open your mind, saying, ‘I want what’s best for myself and my daughter,’ you have to be okay with however that looks.”

The couple had been together since 2006, when they met on the set of the dance flick Step Up. They later went on to tie the knot in 2009, and welcomed their daughter in 2013.

Elsewhere in the interview, Dewan also spoke about her experiences as a mother—and the mom-shaming that can sometimes come with it. (She recently faced criticism for posting so-called “too-sexy” photos on Instagram.) “Apparently, when you become a mother, you’re supposed to leave your sexuality at the door, and I never understood that,” she said of the experience. “I think there’s nothing sexier than becoming a mother. You give life. It’s everything. And you don’t change who you are inside just because you have a kid.”",0

One of the most telling interviews about the divorce was Lambert's chat with Cosmopolitan for its January 2016 issue.

During the interview, the ""Tin Man"" singer said she wasn't going to ""live in fear"" about possibly missing her shot at a happily ever after. However, she suggested she still had some healing to do.

""I think I'm still gonna go through all those bunch,"" she replied when asked if she'd done through the various grieving stages. ""I'm sure I have a hundred more heartbreaks ahead of me. We all do. But I'm a songwriter, so I'm okay with it. My favorite records are not because people lived fully happy lives. There are pockets of sadness.""

She also said she was ""not going to be one of those artists who wallows in my misery so I can be artistic.""

""I just want to live a life full of everything,"" she told the magazine. ""Some of that might mean nights on my porch crying, drinking whiskey, and going, ‘Man, this sucks right now.' I don't necessarily want to know that I have really bad, long, lonely nights ahead of me, but I have had some, and I still have a bunch ahead of me. But it's about living in the moment and feeling every tinge of pain, then waking up the next day and going, ‘All right, I'm going to ride my ponies. I'm going to have a girls' night.' That's where I am. That's where I'm gonna live. I know I have great girlfriends and family and that there are awesome times and adventures ahead. I'm excited about those.""

In addition, she spoke highly about her ex, who had now started dating Stefani.

"" I had a great relationship and an amazing man. So I know what good is,"" she told Cosmoplitan at one point. ""I have a great launching pad for the future. I will never take that for granted.""

And even though she told the magazine she gave the marriage ""everything"" she had, she also admitted that marriage is a ""tough business.""

""We were together for 10 years, married for four, were very quickly divorced, and are friends. I'm still processing everything and figuring out where to go and what happened,"" she told Cosmopolitan. ""[Marriage is] a tough business, and we gave it our best college try. I met him at 21—I am now almost 32. You change as people. If I'm not a different person than I was at 21, then something's wrong with me. I do have a completely different outlook on marriage and what it should be about. If I ever were to get married again—which is completely not on my radar at all right now— I feel like it's not about it being a step in life. It's not about a piece of paper or a diamond.

156,"Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton had an affair, her ex claims It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.

Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.

""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.

But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.

Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.

""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.

""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.

Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""

He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""

Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.

It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.

The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.

Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.

Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""",0

159,"Britney Spears Appears Terrified as Man Crashes Stage During Vegas Residency: 'He's Got a Gun?' Britney Spears‘ return to her Piece of Me Las Vegas residency after a summer hiatus got off to a terrifying start when a fan rushed the stage.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

The incident occurred Wednesday night just as the 35-year-old pop star finished performing “(You Drive Me) Crazy” towards the end of her set at the AXIS auditorium inside Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. In a video obtained by TMZ, Spears engaged the crowd, initially unaware that a man had climbed onto the stage, attempting to get her attention. Quick-thinking dancers encircled the crasher until security agents arrived onstage and surrounded the headliner.

“Is something OK?” Spears asked. “What’s going on? What’s wrong?” Then — visibly frightened — she gasped, “He’s got a gun?” Her mic was switched off as she was rushed to safety offstage. Loyal fans voiced their support, chanting, “We love you!”

(Warning: The video above contains graphic language.)

The man (who did not have a gun) struggled with security, even kicking a member of the force as he executed a cartwheel. Muscular members of her dance squad gathered to subdue the man until more security guards arrived, at which point the intruder was restrained and escorted offstage to chants of “A–hole! from the crowd. Before he was ejected from the theater, the man succeeded in kneeing one of the guards.

Las Vegas law enforcement officials told PEOPLE that the intruder was 37-year-old Jess Webb, who apparently had been acting disorderly during the performance. After allegedly being asked to leave, Webb leapt to the stage. He was arrested for trespassing after the incident.

“On Aug. 9, 2017, officers from the LVMPD arrested 37-year-old Jesse Webb for trespassing during a Britney Spears concert. Webb was asked to leave the concert by security prior to him jumping on stage and dancing,” the statement read. “Webb was transported to the Clark County Detention Center.”

Just before the show, Spears had tweeted a warm message to her Vegas audience.

160,"Michael Strahan, Sara Haines Will Host ABC’s New ‘GMA’ Hour ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.

A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.

Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.

The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.

“Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.

“GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.

The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.

Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.",0
161,"Everything We Know About Brad Pitt’s Plane Incident Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for WSJ Magazine

Yesterday, multiple outlets reported that Brad Pitt is under investigation for child abuse by both the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services after an incident that occurred on his family’s private plane last Wednesday. More details have emerged about the incident that reportedly caused Angelina Jolie to file for divorce and request full custody of the couple’s six children. Us Weekly is reporting that at least part of the alleged fight was caught on film, and TMZ and People are reporting that the fight involved Pitt and Jolie’s 15-year-old son, Maddox.

According to TMZ, “the details of precisely what happened” are “murky,” but the anonymous person who reported Pitt to the DCFS alleged that Pitt “attacked” Maddox on the family’s flight home from Nice, France. From TMZ:

Here’s what’s alleged – shortly after the plane took off, Brad and Angelina began arguing and Maddox jumped up to verbally defend his mom. We’re told Brad then lunged at the boy and Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband. Brad connected in some fashion with his son.

People, which has presented Pitt’s side of the divorce story throughout the week, reports that Pitt “did not hit” Maddox during the incident. A source close to Pitt provided People with the following account:

Pitt “was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,” says the source. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.”



The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. “He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.”



A source close to Pitt says any accusations beyond that are “a combination of exaggerations and lies. They have taken the overall smallest kernel of truth – that a fight got out of hand and reached a regrettable peak, and that as a result DCFS is looking into it – and they are manipulating it to best suit their attempts to gain custody.”

Lainey Lui of Lainey Gossip points out that, at some point last night, People removed the following sentence from the report: “The Pitt source adds that the star ‘was not black-out drunk’ and that ‘he absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.’”

TMZ notes that Pitt’s sources and Jolie’s sources do not agree on whether or not Pitt was drunk during the incident, so that point remains unclear. TMZ reported yesterday that sometime after the incident, the plane landed in Minnesota to refuel, and “that’s when eyewitnesses say Brad was ‘out of control’ on the tarmac and even tried to leave in a fuel truck.”

Pitt has yet to release an official statement regarding the allegations. Us Weekly reports that, on the video of the incident, Pitt can be seen “looking drunk” and “yelling.” Us Weekly’s source claims, however, that “nothing physical” happens on the tape.

According to TMZ, Pitt still plans to fight for joint custody of his children.

164,"Beyonce and Jay Z Welcome Twins (Report) – Variety Beyoncé Knowles and Jay Z have welcomed twins, according to Roger Friedman’s ShowBiz 411.

It is unknown precisely when the singer gave birth, though it stands to reason that it would have been on or around June 15, as Jay Z was due to be honored that night in New York City at the Songwriters Hall of Fame, but did not attend the ceremony.

The sex of the twins is also unknown, but former U.S. President Barack Obama hinted at the arrival of two girls in a video message broadcast at the Songwriters Hall of Fame. They’ll join big sister Blue Ivy Carter, born in January 2012.

Beyoncé announced her pregnancy via Instagram on February 1. The post — showing the singer embracing her baby bump in a garden scene — broke records on the social media platform. The post currently has nearly 11 million likes.

She performed at the Grammys later that month in a visual spectacle that included holographic technology. During the show, she took home trophies for Best Urban Contemporary Album (for “Lemonade”) and Best Music Video (for “Formation”). Despite having the most nominations, she got shut out in the top four categories to Adele.

Beyoncé has kept a low profile in recent months, dropping out of Coachella (she was replaced by Lady Gaga) in April and skipping the Met Gala in May.

The Carter family is reportedly looking at properties in Los Angeles, having made a $120 million offer on a brand new Bel-Air property designed by architect Paul McClean.

Reps for the couple have not responded to requests for comment.

Update: Mathew Knowles, Beyonce Knowles’ father, tweeted an announcement of the twins’ arrival on June 18 (Father’s Day).",0
165,"Harry Styles Splits With Girlfriend Tess Ward After Just One Month Of Dating It’s too much to bear! Just one day after Harry Styles’ stepfather Robin Twist reportedly passed away, a new report has surfaced that his food blogger girlfriend Tess Ward broke up with him!

Our hearts are shattered for Harry Styles, 23! His beautiful new girlfriend Tess Ward allegedly broke up with him, according to a report form The Sun on June 21. Their source claims that Tess called off the relationship because she “realized she still had feelings for her ex after splitting from him to date Harry and has apologized to him for her romance with the singer.” Just one month into her romance with the One Direction front-man, she allegedly ran back into her exes arms. “It will take a while for Tess to build back his trust but they have been getting on as normal. She was in London this week and met her ex straight away — they’ve been inseparable since.” Poor Harry! See pics of the blonde food blogger, here.

Though Harry is also currently in England, the source insisted that “Harry and Tess haven’t seen each other for a number of weeks. They’re both constantly travelling the world.” That’s certainly enough to put a nail in the coffin of a relationship. There were warning signs of a rift. In May, Tess admitted in an interview that she was struggling with all of the hate she was getting from 1D fans. “I want a break! I just want a break. It’s been so weird, the hate messages. Very bizarre. I’m not the kind of person who’s interested in fame.”

The report comes on the same day that Radar reported that Harry’s stepfather Robin Twist died. Harry was very close with his supportive stepdad, who married his mom Anne Cox in 2013. We’re so sorry that Harry has to deal with so much heartache right now, but he can always lean on his 1D brothers and fans for support.

167,"RIP, Jack: Mandy Moore shares cast reaction to tragic 'This Is Us' episode Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter SUBSCRIBE

Feb. 5, 2018, 2:42 PM UTC / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines

(Spoiler alert: If you haven't watched the latest episode of ""This Is Us"" ... what are you waiting for?! Check it out, and then come back here!)

It was the ending ""This Is Us"" fans have been waiting for almost since the series began. No more teases, hints or guesswork — on Sunday night's episode, Jack Pearson died.

And it was absolutely brutal.

Mandy Moore, who plays wife Rebecca to Milo Ventimiglia's Jack, stopped by TODAY Monday morning to commiserate about the loss and to make a confession about how the cast feels now that the major plot point is behind them.

""I think all of us are tremendously relieved,"" she explained. ""Because Milo and I, for one, have known since the beginning. ... But it's just nice to sort of pop that bubble a little.""

Of course, you'd be hard-pressed to find a fan who would describe their own morning-after mood the same way.

Milo Ventimiglia as Jack, Mandy Moore as Rebecca on ""This Is Us."" NBC

No amount of anticipation could have prepared viewers for the gut-punch of the Pearson family patriarch's final moments, which somehow managed to be completely expected and totally shocking at the same time.

Leading into the special post-Super Bowl installment of the tearjerker drama, Jack's final fate seemed known — surely he died in the house fire a faulty appliance sparked in the previous episode.

Except, that's not quite how it happened.

Instead, Jack heroically cleared his family out of the home and even went back into the blaze to save Kate's dog. Sure, he was covered in soot, suffered a burn and had a cough, but he actually survived the fire.

All he needed to do was go to the hospital to treat his singed arm. But while Rebecca casually popped off for a snack in the waiting area, a doctor came out and revealed that Jack was dead. Just like that. It wasn't the fire that took him — not directly. The smoke he inhaled taxed his system and prompted a catastrophic heart attack.

Yet that shocking twist wasn't even the most difficult part of the tragedy. That distinction goes to Rebecca for her heartbreaking reaction.

She didn't see it coming. She didn't believe the doctor. She had to go see him for herself.

""Jack? Babe?""

That's when the nation's supply of tissues took a tumble.

And despite Moore's talk of feeling relief now that it's over, on TODAY, the actress admitted that moment left all the show's stars in tears.

""Pretty much all of the episodes affect all of us, like, we all cry,"" she said. But this one not only brought tears, it took away their words. ""We saw the episode together as a cast at Dan Fogelman's house last week, and none of us could speak afterwards. We were sort of speechless.""

It's not surprising that Jack's death would prompt a moment of silence. After all, viewers are definitely grieving today.

At least they don't have to be sad about waiting for the next episode. The drama returns Tuesday night.

""Now we can move forward with the show and answer more pressing questions, as well,"" Moore told us.

More pressing than how Jack died? Time to buy more tissues!",0

A reeling Johnny Depp is begging ex-wife Vanessa Paradis to get back together, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.

“Johnny now realizes that what he had with Vanessa was one of a kind,” an insider admitted of the 54-year-old, who finalized his disastrous divorce from Amber Heard, 31, in January. “She’s about the only person who can keep him in check, and the only person he really listens to.”

“Vanessa has been there for Johnny throughout this entire thing. She’ll always stand by him,” echoed Heather Rassel, who was married to Depp’s nephew Billy Rassel and remains close to the family.

As Radar reported, Depp ended his 14-year relationship to the mother of his children in 2012. He soon stepped out with Heard, and the two wed in 2015 — but the marriage ended one year later amid the actress’ domestic abuse claims and substance abuse allegations.

“I’m rooting for them to get back together,” Rassel added. “We all are. It would be great from the kids’ perspective.”

Unfortunately for Depp, sources revealed that the mother of Lily-Rose, 18, and Jack, 15 has moved on with French writer Samuel Benchetrit.

On Monday, the Dancing With the Stars pro — who missed last week’s show — put on his dancing shoes to compete with partner Vanessa Lachey in a routine commemorating her most memorable year.

When the celebrity and pro dancer couples were introduced at the top of the show, audiences saw Chmerkovskiy return with Lachey.

Last week, DWTS co-host Erin Andrews informed viewers that Chmerkovskiy’s absence was due to “a personal issue,” but sources told PEOPLE that the DWTS pro, 37, and Lachey, 36, had been “bickering” since the beginning of the competition and that he chose to sit out from rehearsals and the live show due to a clash between their “big personalities.”

But on Wednesday, Chmerkovskiy apologized to Lachey for his absence, which left his partner to perform with first-time pro Alan Bersten.

“As you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues. I take full responsibility for my absence. And want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!” the father of one wrote.

PEOPLE’s special issue, 25 Seasons of Dancing with the Stars, is on stands now.

On Monday, Chmerkovskiy’s wife — and fellow DWTS pro — Peta Murgatroyd shared with PEOPLE that even though “a lot was made of the fact that Maks missed last week’s show,” only a “few people know how crazy this show really gets — not only physically on your body but mentally as well.”

“We care about our partners, and that’s what makes it so hard sometime, because you care and love each other, and you want them to do so well. You invest so much time-wise, and you just want them to be the best and get the best results possible at the end of the day on the Monday night. But it is difficult to deal with life, stresses, rehearsals and then show time and everything that goes along with that,” she added.

While this isn’t the first time Chmerkovskiy has been rumored to clash with his DWTS counterpart — in 2015 he told The Real that his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, is “literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future” — an insider insisted that he and Lachey are a unified pair.

“Angelina is getting more aggressive ever with her fashion choices and social appointments in order to make a maximum impression, especially at events where there’s no chance Brad Pitt or any of his extensive network of Hollywood colleagues will be attending,” an insider revealed.

“This is a good year for Angelina to make this kind of move because she’s a serious contender for Best Foreign Language Film” with First They Killed My Father, said the source.

It also helps that single-mom Jolie, 42, probably won’t have to deal with any awkward Oscar run-ins with her ex.

“Brad’s company is not in contention with a major film as they have been in all three of the previous awards seasons,” noted the insider.

176,"Mel C refusing Spice Girls 2016 reunion without Victoria Beckham They had huge success with their reunion tour in December 2007 - but that was as a five piece.

Now Mel C is reportedly refusing to go ahead with a second comeback tour, which will mark the band's 20th anniversary in 2016, without fifth member Victoria Beckham.

According to reports in The Sun, Mel, 41, formerly known as Sporty Spice, is arguing that Posh Spice needs to rejoin Emma Bunton, Mel B and Geri Horner for the tour to be a success.

Scroll down for video

Something's missing: Mel C (far right, here in December 2012) is reportedly refusing to go ahead with 2016's Spice Girls reunion with (from left) Mel B, Geri Horner (nee Halliwell) and Emma Bunton, in the absence of fifth member Victoria Beckham

A source told the newspaper: 'To fulfill this Mel believes the band has to be the original five-piece and Victoria needs to be involved.'

The Spice Girls originally agreed on an 'indefinite hiatus' in 1998 when Ginger Spice Geri decided to leave the group.

They put their differences aside in the next decade and reunited in their original formation with a tour called The Return Of The Spice Girls, which also included a performance at the London 2012 Olympics, and grossed over £47M and produced £71M in ticket sales and merchandising.

Old friends: The pair laid claim to one of the strongest friendships in the group, while Mel B and Geri were reportedly always at loggerheads

This time around, Victoria - who lays claim to an international fashion empire under her own name - is said to have ducked out because she is 'too busy.'

A source told MailOnline in August: 'Victoria loved her time as a Spice Girl and wishes the girls nothing but success & happiness however she is now too busy running her brand and fulfilling the needs of her family.'

The remaining four-piece are also reportedly 'bickering' over management, agreeing that the spectacular will need 'good management, good tour promoters and good sponsorship' to work.

'The politics is making it hard,' added the source, confirming that the relationships between the women are still as tumultuous as they once were.

Back together: (From left) Mel B, Mel C, Geri, Emma and Victoria reunited in 2012 to take part in The Return Of The Spice Girls tour

Reflecting on the band's conflicts in 2012, Mel C - real name Melanie Chisholm - candidly admitted that the band nearly split many times before Geri decided to called time on the band, shedding light on a particular rift between Geri and Scary Spice Mel B.

She said: '[Geri] left before but not publicly. I mean, I think a few of them had left, well, Melanie and Geri left a few times. I nearly got kicked out once as well, but that’s another story.

'So yeah, I mean, it was difficult and you know, I think Geri would say these things herself. But you know she was having some personal issues and it’s no secret that her and Melanie had a very fiery relationship in the past.'

She continued: 'They, they are the closest of all of the band. You know, they’re absolutely in each other’s pockets or they can fight like cat and dog.'",0
177,"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Will Reportedly Have a Baby as Soon as They Can Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been pretty clear about their desire to start a family eventually. But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. “Having children is definitely a priority,” a source close to Markle told Us. “She and Harry want to start a family right away—and she’ll start trying as soon as she can.”

A second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less ""this'll happen ASAP."" “They both can’t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They’ll make fantastic parents.”

A third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. “Doria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She’s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.”

Harry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements. Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.

In their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, ""No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.""

At an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, ""I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”

Christina Aguilera was infatuated with a guy who was into guys.

When discussing the inspiration behind her 2002 song “Infatuation” on “RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked” on Thursday, she admitted, “It was heartbreaking because I found out he played for your team, not mine.”

Aguilera, 37, didn’t reveal her muse’s name, but she previously told MTV News that the track was inspired by her ex-boyfriend, dancer Jorge Santos, whom she dated for two years.

After her split from Santos, whom she described as her “first love,” Aguilera married Jordan Bratman, from whom she split in 2010. The “Genie in a Bottle” singer is currently engaged to longtime love Matthew Rutler.

In addition to spilling the tea, Aguilera shared some advice with the aspiring drag performers.

“Once you obtain a certain level of success, you can become jaded and you can see certain people around you change,” she said. “That can make you change and feel guarded or shut down and weird. But I think as long as you keep remembering who you are as a person — and keep remembering the good and the good around you — then nothing can stop you.”",0

It's been almost two years since Angelina Jolie announced her split from Brad Pitt, and their divorce continues to get ugly.

In court documents filed Tuesday, Jolie's attorneys allege Pitt hasn't paid any ""meaningful"" child support for a year and a half. Now, she's planning to seek a court order for retroactive funds.

NBC News obtained the court docs, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, in which Jolie's lawyers request a status conference with a judge.

""(Pitt) has a duty to pay child support,"" wrote Jolie attorney Samantha Bley DeJean, NBC reports. ""As of present, (Pitt) has paid no meaningful child support since separation.""

But a person familiar with the situation not authorized to speak publicly disputes the notion Pitt has not been financially responsible for his children, telling USA TODAY Pitt has fulfilled his commitments.

""The aim of Angelina's routine court filing is to provide closure to the marriage in a way that clears a path toward the next stage of their lives and allows her and Brad to recommit as devoted coparents to their children,"" Jolie spokesperson Mindy Nyby tells USA TODAY.

The couple have six children: Maddox, 17; Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12; and 10-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.

On the career front, both actors have been busy. Jolie has been filming ""Maleficent 2"" this summer in London, while Pitt is currently filming Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. Pitt's upcoming sci-fi film ""Ad Astra"" is set for release on January 11, 2019.

Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016, claiming the separation was ""for the health of the family."" The famous couple proceeded to battle publicly – always through their reps – for months over custody of their children.

But Jolie and Pitt seemed to bury the hatchet in January 2017, releasing a joint statement saying they had agreed to handle their divorce in a private forum and would work together to reunify their family.

That changed this June, when their custody struggle exploded in the spotlight once again after multiple outlets reported Jolie could be in danger of losing custody if she didn't start encouraging her children to forge relationships with her ex.

A judge in Jolie and Pitt's divorce case determined that their six children's lack of “a relationship with their father is harmful to them,” adding that, “it is critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother.”

Representatives for Jolie pushed back, calling the reports inaccurate and an unfair depiction of what was going on behind the scenes.

Jolie continues to be represented by divorce lawyer Laura Wasser, Nyby said. Pitt has been represented by Lance Spiegel.

Lawyers for Pitt and Jolie did not respond to requests for comment.

James Franco, 39, is so surprised that Scarlett Johansson, 33, decided to call him out in her powerful speech at the 2018 Women’s March in Los Angeles on Jan. 20 that he’s not sure if or when he will respond. “James was pretty stunned that Scarlett called him out—albeit not by name, but pretty obviously,” a source close to James EXCLUSIVELY revealed to HollywoodLife.com. “He’s not going to respond though because he feels that by doing so he just adds fuel to the fire. James is stuck between a rock and a hard place—if he responds then it’s like he’s disparaging those women who are speaking out, and if he doesn’t then some may think he assumes a level of guilt.” Although five women have come forward to accuse the actor of alleged sexual misconduct since Ally Sheedy cryptically tweeted about him during the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, he has denied the accusations. Check out some of the best pics from the 2018 Women’s March here!

Despite the claims, James has been supporting the Time’s Up movement and doesn’t want to be stereotyped from the recent headlines about him. “James was horrified that he was branded as some kind of sexual aggressor—as far as he’s concerned that couldn’t be further from the truth,” the source continued. “He’s a big supporter of the movement, and he’s really happy that women are finally being given a voice—if he has to take a hit, for something he swears he hasn’t done, then so be it. James knows what’s in his heart, and he knows that he’s a good person.”

With James claiming to have his own story about his past, there’s been high anticipation about where the accusations toward him will lead. Only time will tell with this situation but one thing remains in tact: women in the entertainment industry and beyond are fighting back hard to stand up for what they believe in! In addition to Scarlett, high profile actresses such as Natalie Portman, 36, Eva Longoria, 42, and Alyssa Milano, 45, spoke out about their own personal stories at the Women’s March in LA and Atlanta.

181,"Kelly Ripa Leaving ‘Live’? Her Relationship With Ryan Seacrest May Not Be All Unicorns And Rainbows After Ryan Seacrest’s former hair stylist at the E! Network accused him of sexual harassment this past week, his co-host on Live!, Kelly Ripa, came to his defense on their show. But despite her words of support, Seacrest and Ripa’s friendship may not be as good as it seems on air.

According to Page Six, Ripa doesn’t want to risk anything happening to her popular morning show, and she is livid because the allegations against Seacrest could potentially mess things up.

“They oversell their friendship…Her reputation is rolled up in this — this is her show. For Kelly, there’s not a Plan B. She has to make a decision and rally around him,” claims a source.

Seacrest has denied the allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him by Suzie Hardy, who claims that the American Idol host pushed her head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes. An anonymous source who also worked with Seacrest has corroborated Hardy’s story, claiming that they witnessed the behavior multiple times.

#babydaddy ?? A post shared by Kelly Ripa (@kellyripa) on Jan 31, 2018 at 9:43am PST

Earlier in the week, Ripa appeared to take a dig at Seacrest when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after a discussion of a possible treadmill day for the show. Seacrest stammered as he replied, “You don’t mind, do you?”

He then stomped his own shoes on himself.

But, the next day, Ripa sang her co-host’s praises when she declared in front of their audience that Seacrest is a privilege to work with and she adores him. She added that she is looking forward to seeing Seacrest on the red carpet at the Oscars, and he is a professional and great person. She concluded by saying that she is lucky to work with him every day.

Ripa famously had a meltdown when her former co-host Michael Strahan quit the show without giving her any kind of notice. And, since Seacrest joined her last May, he has done everything he can to stay on Ripa’s good side, because she has a lot of pull on Live! and influence over him.

When Seacrest was supposed to appear on ABC’s Good Morning America – which Strahan now co-hosts – to promote the new American Idol with Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan, and Katy Perry, he pulled the plug on the appearance at the last second at Ripa’s request.

Apparently, at the time, Kelly Ripa was worried about Ryan Seacrest’s new affiliation with ABC and was worried that they will eventually take him away from Live! too.

Another traveler told the Washington Post that four passengers were asked to leave a flight from Chicago to St. Louis on Sunday night to make room for four airline employees. One man declined to leave, saying he was a doctor who had to see patients in the morning. The airline manager would not relent, and the man yelled that he was being targeted because he was Chinese, a passenger told the Post. When he refused to give up his seat, police officers boarded, pulled him screaming from his seat, and dragged him by his arms through the aisle — a scene that horrified other passengers, according to videos taken by witnesses and posted on the internet.

Another video, recorded after the initial incident, shows the man bleeding and repeating, “Just kill me.”

In a statement posted to Twitter, United CEO Oscar Munoz said, “This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation.”

183,"Gwen Stefani: She Might Have To Break Promise To Celebrate Thanksgiving With Blake Shelton In OK Gwens Stefani had the best time spending her 2016 Thanksgiving with boyfriend Blake Shelton and his family in Oklahoma. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she might have to bail on the festivities this year.

Blake Shelton, 41, and Gwen Stefani, 48, have always made holidays together a big priority in their relationship. In 2016 they spent Thanksgiving at his Oklahoma ranch and rang in Christmas at her LA home. They were hoping to do turkey day at his country pad again, but she might have to skip out on the festive meal. “Gwen had the best time with Blake and his family last year at Thanksgiving and she would love to do it all over again. Last year she promised that she’d be back again for this Thanksgiving, but she might have to break her promise. She’s got so much work on her plate all month, it’s going to be very hard for Gwen to pull it all off,” a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

“It’s crunch time for promoting her Christmas album, she’s got so many interviews lined up she’s even doing a meet and greet in LA on Black Friday. She keeps insisting that she can do it all, that she can have the big traditional feast with Blake and his family on Thanksgiving and then race back to LA for work,” our insider continues. Gwen just dropped her first ever holiday album You Make It Feel Like Christmas, on Oct. 6 and as the season draws closer, she’s going to be everywhere in support of it.

Since the Blakester is the BEST BOYFRIEND EVER, he’s agreed to change up his Thanksgiving plans in Oklahoma if she can’t make it there to spend it with him. “Blake absolutely wants her there with his family, but he’s told her if she needs to stay in LA he’ll be with her. Either way they’re going to be together, but Gwen’s goal is to be superwoman and make it all happen. She doesn’t want to miss out,” our source says. See Blake and Gwen’s relationship milestones in pics, here.

Blake played a big part in Gwen deciding to record a Christmas album, as the idea came to her while going for a run on her boyfriend’s ranch. “What if I did write a Christmas song? What would it be?” she told Billboard magazine. She said that within minutes she came up with a melody and lyrics that she laid down in a voice video as soon as she got back to his house. A few weeks later, she recorded her first ever holiday tune “Christmas Eve.” The title track is a duet between Blake and Gwen that we’re sure will be a total holiday classic for years to come.

184,"California Supreme Court Rejects 'Friends' Lawsuit, Defends Sanctity Of Writers' Room This image was lost some time after publication.

Sitcom producers all over town will be relieved to discover that the California Supreme Court upheld the no-dead-baby-rape-joke-too-foul sanctity of the writers' room today, ruling that the Friends staff was merely performing their duties when they speculated about the contents of Courteney Cox's uterus, discussed their personal views on the necessity of foreplay, or pitched out unorthodox ideas for Joey's day job:

The justices, ruling 7-0, agreed with Warner Bros. Television Productions that trash talk was part of the creative process and, therefore, the studio and its writers could not be sued for raunchy writers' meetings. The court added that no jury would believe the writers' assistant was the target of harassment during profanity-laced meetings. ""The record discloses that most of the sexually coarse and vulgar language at issue did not involve and was not aimed at plaintiff or other women in the workplace,"" Justice Marvin Baxter wrote. [...]

Amaani Lyle, 32, alleged six years ago that raw sexual remarks peppering work sessions and conversations added up to harassment against women. Lyle said she was offended by repeated references to the actors' sex lives and to the writers' own sexual exploits as they penned the successful NBC sitcom rife with bawdy banter about six New York City friends. She was fired after four months on the job, allegedly because she could not transcribe meetings fast enough or capture the flavor of the meetings.

Perhaps the most important legal precedent set by this decision is the affirmation of a sitcom staff's ability to fire assistants over their inadequate typing/transcribing skills, the standard industry excuse used by confrontation-averse writers to terminate someone they don't like.",0

It was houses. They currently own one for each child (six), with a spare for guests or their shoes or whatever you need a seventh home for.

The couple brought significant assets to the union and have only added more, including a charity which was responsible for helping rebuild in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, giving them a combined net worth of about US$400 million (NZ$547m).

THE HOUSES

SPLASH NEWS An aerial view of the Craftsman style home the Jolie-Pitts called home. Brad lived there with Jennifer Aniston during their marriage - but will he give it up for Angelina Jolie and the kids?

The Jolie-Pitts have seven houses in various spots around the world, but the family home is a sprawling Craftsman style home in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, that Brad Pitt had previously lived in with jilted ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston.

While his prior ownership of the home might suggest Pitt will keep the home in this divorce too, it's been extensively remodelled for the kids and now includes a huge swimming pool, park land, and an area for dirtbike-riding – something his son Maddox enjoys.

Maybe Angie will want to keep things as normal as possible for her brood in the Los Feliz house, or perhaps she'll want to ship them out to France – her ancestral and spiritual home – where the couple owns the frankly enormous Chateau Miraval.

PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval, the US$60m estate which is owned by actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

Costing about US$60m and boasting a 30-acre vineyard (famous for a rose called ""Pink Floyd"") and 35 bedrooms (just how many kids did these guys want?), Pitt and Jolie were married in the chateau's chapel in August, 2014.

So, maybe it won't be high on Jolie's list of places to lie low until the news cycle has rolled over them. Perhaps the beach then if it's privacy the divorcees are after?

That's doable, since the pair have what passes for a bach in Hollywood up the coast in Santa Barbara. It comes with 11 acres of land around it and a private beach in front of it, for max seclusion.

PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval.

Pitt bought it in 2000 for US$4m, in recent years the family has used it mainly as a holiday home. But maybe he'll head up there to lick his wounds?

Pitt's also the reluctant owner of a villa in New Orleans that he's been trying to offload since 2015.

The pair bought the five-bed-five-bath home to live in while Pitt was in Nola filming The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It's on the market now for the bargain basement price of US$5.5m.

Ray Tamarra Brad Pitt greets a friend from his New Orleans balcony on May 17, 2014 in New Orleans.

Then there's also Jolie's Laurel Canyon home, and an apartment in New York's Waldorf Astoria building.



THE FOUNDATION

The pair started the Jolie-Pitt Foundation together in 2006. However it seems most likely to be Jolie who'll take over the running of the charity.

The Foundation has donated to various causes including the Hurricane Katrina and Joplin tornado rebuilds; children's health centres in Ethiopia and Cambodia; the Na'an ku se Foundation in Namibia; GlobaL Action for Children; the HALO Trust and Doctors Without Borders.

But it's Jolie who puts her money (and her time) where her mouth is most often as a UN Goodwill ambassador, Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award winner and vocal crusader for children and women.



THE FILM COMPANY

Plan B Entertainment was the brainchild of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, that Brad took custody of in the divorce.

To date, it's been responsible for a huge range of films, from gritty horror World War Z to Oscar-winning marvels Selma and 12 Years a Slave.

Pitt is the sole owner of the company, but could Jolie angle for a piece of that cinematic pie in the settlement?

Too supportive, according to the superstitious Cowboys fans who blamed Simpson's presence on the sidelines for a decline in his play, as well as their winter vacation in Mexico for the Cowboys' loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants in their NFC division playoff game in January 2008.

""You know, it's very hard when you lose, because games are important, and so many people put so much time and effort in,"" Romo told VF. ""It's nice to have someone to come home to and try and make you feel better.""

""That's how the story goes,"" Simpson offered. ""Can't help it. But we don't let it affect our relationship. If we did, we wouldn't be together, because it happened at the very beginning. Dating the Cowboys quarterback comes with hype, the fans, the bloggers, but I've never dated a guy that was more simple. I'm always there for him after a game, and he knows he has me to come home to.""

Ashton Kutcher, 39, is still processing the numerous rape allegations that have been made against his friend and The Ranch co-star Danny Masterson, 41. Masterson has since been fired by Netflix from the show in which he and Kutcher both work on. “Ashton has been rocked by the firing of his friend Danny,” a source close to Kutcher tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He doesn’t want to believe any of the accusations against his longtime friend, but he does hope the truth will come out.” However, Kutcher knew he had to do what was best for everyone involved. “As one of the executives on the show, Ashton is agreeing to swift action being taken. He is trying to protect the show and jobs of others working on the project. He just feels horrible about the whole situation.” Kutcher has yet to release an official statement following the allegations of misconduct against Masterson.

Kutcher has been Masterson is also known for starring alongside Kutcher and his wife,, 34, in That 70’s Show. And, as we previously reported, the news shocked Kunis as well. Kutcher has been leaning on his wife since the cast shake up on The Ranch. The show — which is reportedly on the brink of wrapping the first 10 episodes of its third season — made the decision to move forward without Masterson on Dec. 5. “As a result of ongoing discussions, Netflix and the producers have written Danny Masterson out of ‘The Ranch’,” the entertainment company said in a statement to our sister site Deadline . “Yesterday was his last day on the show, and production will resume in early 2018 without him.” It’s unclear exactly how Masterson’s character, Rooster, will be written out of the series.

A rep for Masterson released the following statement to HollywoodLife.com shortly after the news broke: “I am obviously very disappointed in Netflix’s decision to write my character off of The Ranch. From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all. In the meantime, I want to express my gratitude to the cast and crew that I’ve worked so closely with over the past three seasons. I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so.”

188,"Life, Movies & Family Born in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé Knowles first captured the public's eye as lead vocalist of the R&B group Destiny's Child. She later established a solo career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of music's top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards. Knowles has also starred in several films, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording artist Jay-Z in 2008. In late 2013, she surprised audiences by releasing her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyoncé, and has twice performed at the Super Bowl. She released her sixth studio album, Lemonade, after the airing of an HBO special in April 2016, and two years later she dropped a joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love, while the two were on tour.

Singer and actress Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She started singing at an early age, competing in local talent shows and winning many of these events by impressing audiences with her singing and dancing abilities.

On the musical front, Beyoncé took center stage as a solo artist, releasing her first album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. The recording became a huge success for her both commercially and critically. It sold millions of copies and won five Grammy Awards. On the album, Beyoncé worked with a number of different artists, including Missy Elliott , Sean Paul and Jay-Z. She was rumored to be dating Jay-Z around this time, but the couple did not publicly acknowledge their relationship.

While enjoying her group's success, Beyoncé began exploring other projects. She made her acting debut in 2001 with a starring role in MTV's Carmen: A Hip Hopera. She then co-starred with Mike Myers in the Austin Powers spy parody Goldmember the following year.

Teaming up with her cousin, Kelly Rowland , and two classmates, Beyoncé formed an all-female singing group. Her father, Matthew Knowles, served as the band's manager. The group went through some name and line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia Records. Destiny's Child soon became one of the most popular R&B acts, with the release of their first, self-titled album. Gaining momentum, the group scored its first No. 1 single on the pop charts with ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" off their second album. The recording also featured another smash hit, ""Say My Name.""

On her own, Beyoncé continued to enjoy great success. Her second studio album, 2006's B'Day featured such hits as ""Irreplaceable"" and ""Deja Vu."" On the big screen, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy in Dreamgirls. The film was adapted from the hit Broadway musical of the same name.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z

In 2008, Beyoncé married rapper and music mogul Jay-Z in a small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the wedding were Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles; her father and manager, Matthew; her sister, Solange; Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams; and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.

The newlywed continued to work as hard as ever, promoting her latest effort, I am ... Sasha Fierce (2008). Beyoncé scored two big hits off the album—""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" and ""If I Were a Boy."" She also returned to the big screen that year, starring as R&B legend Etta James in Cadillac Records. The following January, Beyoncé sang James' trademark song, ""At Last,"" for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at his inaugural ball.

In addition to acting and performing, Beyoncé ran a clothing line called House of Dereon with her mother. She also launched her own fragrance, Heat, in 2010. Throughout her career, Beyoncé has served as a spokesperson and model for several other brands, including L'Oreal and Tommy Hilfiger.

Beyoncé found herself under fire after performing a private concert for Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi on New Year's Eve in 2010. She later donated her fee from the event to help victims of the Haitian earthquake. According to some reports, Beyoncé said that her father had been responsible for arranging the Libyan concert. She decided to drop her father as her manager in March 2011. Later that year, Beyoncé reached the top of the album charts with her latest solo release, 4.

In January 2013, Beyoncé generated some negative headlines for her performance at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C. She was criticized for reportedly pre-recording a version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and lip-syncing to her own track during the outdoor ceremony. Despite wide media coverage, in the days following the incident, Beyoncé did not publicly address the controversy.

Not long after, prior to her appearance at Super Bowl XLVII, Beyoncé performed the song live at a press conference. She explained to reporters that she had used a ""backing track"" at the inauguration, adding that she would ""absolutely be singing live"" at the NFL's biggest event of the year, according to The Huffington Post.

Indeed, Beyoncé more than redeemed herself in the public eye at the Super Bowl on February 3, 2013. During the event's halftime show, she took the stage and wowed the crowd, joined by her former Destiny's Child bandmates Rowland and Williams for parts of her performance. Beyoncé also announced that her next major tour would start in the spring of 2013.

Awards, Accolades and Surprise Album

At the 2010 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé walked away with six honors—the most wins in a single night by a female artist. Her record was matched two years later by pop/soul artist Adele. In 2010, she also tied the record for most No. 1 hits on Billboard’s Pop Songs chart, which is based on radio airplay. In 2011, she made the Forbes Top 10 list of entertainment's highest-earning women. By 2013, Beyoncé had won 16 Grammys.

Beyoncé broke records once again on December 13, 2013, with her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyoncé. The album surprised fans and critics alike, as no promotion for the album had been announced prior to its release. The record, which Beyoncé called a ""visual album,"" was released exclusively on iTunes, with physical discs available for purchase after December 18. The record-breaking album sold more than 800,000 copies throughout the weekend it was released alone.

The collection—which was the fastest-selling album ever distributed by iTunes—also marked Beyoncé's fifth studio album to debut at No. 1, making her the first woman to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with her first five albums. She released the Platinum Edition of the album in 2014, and the following year won three additional Grammys, including a Best R&B Performance award for ""Drunk in Love.""

Second Super Bowl and 'Lemonade'

In February 2016, Beyoncé returned to the Super Bowl stage, once again earning raves for her performance. This time around she appeared with Bruno Mars and Chris Martin of the band Coldplay, highlighting her new single ""Formation"" and subsequently announcing a world tour. The tune, its video and accompanying halftime show also garnered a wave of attention for politicized lyrics and imagery touching on everything from black power to Hurricane Katrina.

Just two months later, HBO aired an hour-long Beyoncé conceptual film, Lemonade, which presented tracks from the album of the same name released immediately afterward. The cable special showcased the singer reeling from the romantic and sexual betrayal of her partner while acknowledging the strength found in communities of African-American women. Tennis star Serena Williams and young actress Quvenzhané Wallis also made appearances in the New Orleans-based project, which was helmed by a variety of directors and featured poetry from Warsan Shire.

Lemonade the album was only initially available via Tidal, the online streaming service backed by Beyoncé's spouse, Jay-Z, and then eventually became available on iTunes and Amazon with its accompanying film. Musical contributors to the project, which quickly garnered acclaim, included Jack White, The Weeknd, James Blake and Kendrick Lamar. Lemonade debuted at No. 1, making Beyoncé the only artist in history to have all of her first six studio albums reach the top of Billboard's album charts.

In February 2017, a pregnant Beyoncé delivered a surprise performance at the Grammys, singing songs from Lemonade amid a swirling spectacle of lights, holograms and backup dancers. Although she lost the coveted Album of the Year Grammy to Adele, she did take home two awards, for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video.

Known as ""Queen Bey,"" the famed singer readied to take on the role of a different queen with the November 2017 announcement that she was headlining a remake of Disney's The Lion King. Scheduled for a 2019 release, the live-action reboot of the 1994 animated hit will feature Beyoncé as Nala, the budding love interest of the titular character, to be played by Donald Glover.

Shortly afterward, it was revealed that Queen Bey also reigned as the highest-earning female musician of the year. According to Forbes, Beyoncé snagged $105 million in pretax income June 2016 through June 2017, a number that easily outpaced the earnings of fellow divas Adele ($69 million) and Taylor Swift ($44 million). Forbes attributed the windfall to the success of Lemonade and the singer's Formation World Tour, which grossed approximately $250 million.

Coachella, OTR II, 'Everything Is Love,' and 'Homecoming'

In March 2018, reports surfaced that Beyoncé was working on new music and preparing to hit the road with Jay-Z. Following a false alarm in which a tour announcement appeared and quickly disappeared from her Facebook page, the power couple officially announced that their On the Run II (or OTR II) Tour would kick off in Cardiff, Wales, on June 6.

One year after she canceled a planned appearance at Coachella because of her pregnancy, Beyoncé took the stage for an eagerly anticipated performance at the April 2018 music festival. The first black woman to headline the event, Beyoncé wowed attendees and critics alike with her top-shelf singing and choreography, delivering favorites like ""Crazy In Love"" and a rendition of the civil rights anthem ""Lift Every Voice and Sing."" She was also joined during the two-hour set by hubby Jay-Z, sister Solange and her old Destiny's Child cohorts, Rowland and Williams.

One week later, Beyoncé delivered another highly acclaimed show at the festival. While the 27-song set and guest list remained nearly identical, the headliner shook things up with her costume changes, coming across as looser and more ""off-the-cuff,"" according to Rolling Stone.

In June, Beyoncé and Jay-Z embarked on the European leg of their 48-date tour. While they lived up to expectations with their theatrics and swagger, the couple also surprised fans with the release of their joint album, Everything Is Love, following a London show on June 16. Initially available for streaming only on the Jay-Z owned Tidal, the nine-track album was accompanied by a video for the track ""Apes**t,"" which featured the couple and their dancers gallivanting around some of the world's most famous artworks at the Louvre in Paris.

Later in the tour, during a performance in Atlanta, Beyoncé and Jay-Z faced a potentially dangerous moment when an audience member climbed on stage and attempted to chase the stars backstage, before the backup dancers banded together to stop the intruder.

Around that time, Beyoncé earned her fourth cover spread and story for Vogue. The production made headlines for the singer's control over the photo shoot, for which she wore minimal makeup and showed off her natural hair, as well as her unfiltered interview in which she embraced her ""FUPA"" — the leftover weight gain in the abdominal area from her pregnancy.

On April 17, 2019, Beyoncé released a Netflix documentary about her Coachella performance, 'Homecoming,' and a surprise companion album which included 40 live tracks.",0

Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani is the couple we never saw coming, but as they say, ""opposites attract"" — and this couple couldn't be any more opposite.

The country crooner and the No Doubt rocker first fell in love after working together as judges on the popular TV singing competition show The Voice in 2014. The two seemed to connect quickly after both becoming separated from their previous spouses around the same period of time in 2015.

They tried to deny rumors of their budding romance for months, but fans and the media were quick to notice the undeniable chemistry between the singers.

According to E! News, The ""Hollaback Girl"" told Ryan Seacrest on his radio show in 2015 that she thought Blake was ""really hot."" When Seacrest asked if the rumors about them dating at the time were true, Stefani didn't give a straight answer. ""I'm not going to answer that right now, Ryan, I think I've given up enough of myself this morning to you."" Stefani not-so-subtly added, ""I think he's hot, don't you?""

Although at the outset they're an odd pairing, people have come to accept the duo and have grown to love them. But as with every other celebrity couple, they have their fair share of gossip and drama.

1. They got divorced within two months of each other.

Gwen was previously married to singer Gavin Rossdale for 13 years. The former couple shares three sons together, Kingston (11), Zuma (9), and Apollo (4). They announced their drama-filled separation in August 2015.

Blake was previously wed to country singer Miranda Lambert. They announced their divorce in July 2015 with a shared joint statement that said, ""This is not the future we envisioned. And it is with heavy hearts that we move forward separately. We are real people, with real lives, with real families, friends, and colleagues. Therefore, we kindly ask for privacy and compassion concerning this very personal matter.""

2. Gwen revealed one of Blake's exes is a huge fan of hers.

Gwen appeared on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! where she revealed that Blake confessed he once dated a girl who was a big fan of Gwen... like, a really big fan. She stated, “He did tell me that he dated a girl for like three months that had my face all plastered over her whole bedroom so that’s kind of weird, right?""",0
192,"Karrueche Tran Manager Slams Chris Brown Attorney: Domestic Violence Is Real, Not Self-Promotion That hearing, however, has never taken place because Tran has been unable to serve Brown with the original court order. Geragos could accept on his client’s behalf, but has refused. “I’m not here to help anybody increase their profile for self-promotion,” the lawyer told TMZ on Wednesday, further saying Tran was only going after Brown to “enhance” her “profile.” He insisted the model-actress’ allegations are untrue, and said her case against him is “doomed to failure.”

Tran’s manager York is now firing back. “Mark should put up or shut up, but this sleight of hand he’s trying to do, to distract from his client’s current violent issues, is reprehensible,” he tells Gossip Cop exclusively. York continues, “This is real life and real issues, and not a topic that should be used by Mark to spin press. Let them have their day in court and let the chips fall where they fall.”

As Gossip Cop previously noted, one of Tran’s friends also received a temporary restraining order against Brown in March, but has also been unable to face him in court. Most recently, just this week Brown was accused of punching a photographer at a nightclub in Florida. The photographer said he plans to press assault and battery charges. Geragos has not commented on that case.

UPDATE: Mark Geragos responded to this story with a tweet saying, “They can’t even serve CB with a lawsuit. Maybe they should ask their client to do it when she is following CB around the Country #teambreezy.”",0

George & Amal Clooney welcomed twins Ella & Alexander just 3 months ago, but a new report claims the stars could ALREADY be expecting baby #3! Apparently Amal’s showing pregnancy signs, & it may even be twins again!

A third child already? George, 56, and Amal Clooney‘s, 39, friends reportedly believe the star couple are expecting once again, according to Life & Style magazine. And although Amal gave birth to baby twins Ella and Alexander back in June, the two would reportedly be “thrilled” if they were to expand their family once again. “[Amal] has the same symptoms she had when she learned she was pregnant the first time,” an alleged close friend told the magazine. “She’s eating like crazy and is more emotional than normal.” Click here to see pics of Amal’s stunning maternity style.

Her friends apparently believe the human rights lawyer is still in the very early stages of pregnancy, but even weeks from now, there may still be no sign of a bump. “During her first pregnancy, Amal barely showed for the first several months, and was active and working right up until a few weeks before the birth,” the source said. “But she was tired a lot and had trouble getting to a healthy baby weight.” At the same time however, if Amal truly is pregnant, her weight may not be an issue this time around. “Amal’s been loving going out to dinner while the family has been in Italy over the summer,” the insider added. “She’s craving pasta, risotto, and margherita pizza. At times it seems like she could be eating for three!”

And as it turns out, she actually COULD be! “Having twins once does increase your chance of having them again,” Dr. Pari Ghodsi, ob-gyn, shared with the publication. “Older moms are also more likely to have twins.” What’s more, Amal’s sister, Tala, has twins as well, and they tend to run in families. Having three — or four — kids under the age of two would definitely have its challenges, but apparently George “would be thrilled if Amal is indeed pregnant,” the source revealed. “He loves being a dad, and really has a more-the-merrier attitude toward enlarging the family.”

On the other hand though, Amal said in a Sept. 6 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, that she is definitely finished having kids. “I’m 39,” the new mom said with a head shake when asked if she wanted more kids. “I already had them quite late.”

Tell us, HollywoodLifers — do YOU think Amal is pregnant again? Do you think she and George will end up having another kid?",0

While most of the new articles reiterate what was reported initially after the split—that Aniston wasn't planning on being single again but still believes in love, that their relationship had been on its last legs for a while, that a Brad Pitt-Jen reconciliation is highly unlikely—one of the wilder new details is straight from Us Weekly. Apparently, Jennifer Aniston kept Post-Its that Brad Pitt wrote her when they were married. And Justin Theroux found them, a source said!

“He stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” the source explained. “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already.’” These little notes supposedly had a big impact on their relationship. “Jen assured him they weren’t a big deal, but Justin wasn’t thrilled…Justin had moments of insecurity like that.”

People really tried to shoot down the reports that Brad-Jen 2.0 could happen last week. “They’ve been over each other for longer than they were ever together,” a source, with knowledge of Pitt and Aniston's current relationship, told the outlet then. “Now you add six kids on his side and each of them having their own assorted battle scars into the mix? Forget it. It’s not going to happen.”

Plus, “they aren’t in regular contact, beyond an occasional text back and forth to wish each other the best when there’s been a new project or big event,” the source added. Most brutally, the source said, “They broke up, and they did it because they had serious issues. They’re not stupid. They remember why it didn’t work.”

That said, another source told The Blast yesterday that while Aniston and Pitt getting back together isn't about to happen now, they have talked recently. And “something crazy could happen, [but] at this point nothing is going down between them.”",0

Things came to a head at a recent visit to St George's Chapel, where both Meghan and the recently engaged Princess Eugenie are planning on holding their weddings later this year.

With Camilla in tow to help the 27-year-old go over plans for her wedding to Jack Brooksbank, the pair were horrified to bump into Kate and Meghan.

While Kate and Meghan were, of course, very police and lovely, Camilla, 70, took the opportunity to really make her feelings known, telling 36-year-old Meghan that she really disapproves of her wedding to Harry overshadowing Eugenie's.

'When they came face-to-face, Camilla really let Meghan have it. She told her she thought it was atrocious she and Harry were ruining Eugenie's wedding plans - that Harry should have known that Eugenie had always wanted to marry at St George's chapel,' says the insider.

It was confirmed last week that Eugenie has been forced to delay her wedding with the princess originally hoping to tie the knot in September, but settling for October.

Camilla - who is reported to be jealous of Kate and Meghan's rising popularity - has also been causing tension among the royals, with sources saying that one of the scheming duchess' more brazen plots involved trying to convince Kate that Meghan was trying to steal some of her staff.

According to insiders, it was Camilla who was behind the reassignment of Amy Pickerill from Kate and Wills' communications officer to Meghan's first royal assistant.

An insider tells, 'It shows that Camilla will stop at nothing to cause trouble between Kate and Meghan.'

Drake, 31, was admiring his once lady love Rihanna, 29, when they attended the 2018 Grammy Awards on Jan. 28 and he thought her full body was super hot despite all the pregnancy rumors it caused! The gorgeous singer showed up to one of the music’s biggest nights with her beau Hassan Jameel. “Drake thought Rihanna looked incredibly sexy at the Grammys,” a source close to the hip hop star EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “He did not think she looked pregnant at all, just healthy, happy and really sexy. Watching her dance and shaking her body all over the stage really turned him on, he was totally into it. Drake was shocked and surprised over the subsequent pregnancy rumors that followed her big appearance.” Woah! It sounds like Drake is still hooked on RiRi and we can definitely see why! The talented star is known for having confidence in her body and it sure showed during her incredible energetic Grammys performance of “Wild Thoughts.”

Although speculation of a pregnancy soared after Rihanna’s performance, she has yet to publicly comment about it. She is, however, reportedly laughing it off and having the time of her life despite what others think of her weight. Drake may have had great feelings about checking Rihanna out at the Grammys but it quickly turned into disappointment when he found out she was still with Hassan. “He was also disappointed to hear that things between Rihanna and Hassan are still stable and that he was in NYC with her,” the source continued. “Drake still finds Rihanna really sexy, thinks they have great chemistry together and feels like they will get together again one day, hopefully soon.”

Drake and Rihanna have a long history of a complicated on-again, off-again relationship that started around 2009 when they were first spotted together at a bowling alley, according to E! News. From friends to collaborators to lovers, these two have had tons of experience being together so it’s not surprising that Drake would feel such a connection to the beauty. Whether or not they’ll end up together again is yet to be seen but it’s good to know Drizzy can still appreciate all RiRi has to offer!

The battle is ON!

Jennifer Hudson and Kelly Clarkson are two of American Idol’s most famous alumni…but they won’t be on the show’s judging panel when it returns to ABC next year. That’s because both women are already booked as coaches on The Voice for seasons 13 and 14, respectively. So, now, Idol is going after Christina Aguilera, who’s worked for six seasons on The Voice, as revenge. “ABC is ready to make a serious offer to steal Christina from The Voice,” an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “They are looking to pay Christina a lot and sell the fact to her that The Voice has forgotten about her. Idol is very much ready to make the move and hopes Christina bites.”

Christina was one of the original coaches on The Voice, and served on the first three seasons before taking a break during season 4. She returned for seasons 5, 8 and, finally, season 10, when her contestant, Alisan Porter, was named the winner. After that, the powerful singer took some time off to work on her own music, and since J.Hud, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Miley Cyrus have already been confirmed for the upcoming season 13, we know she won’t be back then, either. So far, the fourth coach who will join Kelly, Adam and Blake on season 14 has not been announced.

No American Idol judges have been confirmed just yet, although HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY heard that Katy Perry is very close to signing a deal. The show is also eyeing alums like Chris Daughtry, Fantasia and Carrie Underwood for the reboot, which will premiere in the first half of 2018.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Christina would ever go to American Idol? Do you think she’d be a good coach?",0

For the ""Newsroom"" actress, that means respecting that her boyfriend, the quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, has a lot on his mind come game day. Having sex, she told Bravo's Andy Cohen, is off the table.

""Not on game day,"" she said, during an appearance on ""Watch What Happens Live."" ""There's not a rule, but it just doesn't happen because there's other things to focus on.""

But sleeping together after the game is a possibility, she dished.

""Depends on how late the game is,"" she said, later adding, ""I try to have sex as much as I can.""

Munn, 34, and Rodgers, 31, were first linked earlier this year. And while some have credited her influence on Rodgers for his great stats this season, she brushes off the compliment.

201,"Cost of the royal wedding for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty

The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).

Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.

Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.

Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.

The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).

Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.

The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.

The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.

Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.",0
202,"Matt Lauer's could pay ex-wife Annette Roque $20M in divorce Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)

Shamed “Today” host Matt Lauer is “bending over backwards” to give his soon to be ex-wife Annette Roque everything she wants in their divorce — including a multimillion-dollar payout — because he feels so guilty for cheating with multiple women at work, according to friends.

Lauer — who was axed by NBC bosses in November for a string of inappropriate affairs — has already agreed to pay Roque, his wife of nearly 20 years, up to $20 million, Page Six can reveal.

The couple are now getting along amicably, the friends tell us — and are both spending time at their 12-bedroom Hamptons pile, Strongheart Manor, as they prepare to finalize their divorce.

A source says: “Things really have settled down. Matt and Annette are getting on and they’re both spending time with their kids. They hope to settle the divorce very soon.”

Lauer bought the estate from Richard Gere for $36.5 million in 2016 and used it as a bolthole immediately after he was sacked by NBC.

However, the question remains — who will get the estate in the divorce — as they both love it and it’s Lauer’s “dream home.” It is set on a massive 6.3 acres on the peninsula of North Haven near Sag Harbor.

As we revealed last month, the divorce is nearly official — and the process has been smoother because the couple had already signed a “postnup” after Lauer persuaded a furious Roque to drop her divorce filing in 2006.

At the time, Roque cited “mental abuse, extreme mental and emotional distress, humiliation, torment and anxiety,” after learning that Lauer had been unfaithful. But she withdrew the filing months later after signing the postnup.

A source said: “Matt agreed to pay Annette a lump sum of millions back in 2006 as an incentive to stay with him to help him maintain his squeaky clean image as ‘America’s Dad.’

“She also got an allowance every year, plus it was agreed that she would get a share of the value of all their homes if they did split.”

So far, Lauer has offloaded his Upper East Side apartment for more than its $7.35 million asking price.

The former anchor also has one of his Sag Harbor homes on the market for $12.75 million, a significant drop from the original asking price of $18 million. His New Zealand farm, which he purchased for a reported $9.2 million in February 2017, is currently also still in his possession despite the fact he was poised to lose it as part of the country’s “good character” test following his sexual misconduct allegations.

The source added: “Matt’s bending over backwards to give Annette everything she wants because he feels so guilty. But he would love the Hamptons home.”

Lauer and Roque are believed to have agreed to share custody of their three children, Jack, 17, Romy, 14, and Thijs, 11, in the divorce.

While Lauer has spent the past nine months working on his relationship with his kids, and friends say he is a “devoted dad,” he still feels resentment about his sacking.

The source said: “Matt still maintains the relationships he had in the workplace were consensual. He does feel like the poster boy of the #MeToo movement when he sees other high powered men hanging on to their jobs despite allegations.”

A lawyer for Lauer didn’t return calls.",0

204,"Taylor Swift rips off dress in controversial new music video Just after winning Female Artist of the Year at the iHeartRadio Music Awards, Taylor Swift dropped a new music video for “Delicate,” a track from her latest album, “Reputation.”

Like much of the album, the song hones in on Swift’s public perception over the past year or so.

The video opens with a vacant-looking Swift on the red carpet, dressed in a flapper-inspired sapphire gown and mobbed by reporters and photographers.

She escapes to her dressing room, where the songstress makes funny faces at herself in the mirror. She’s interrupted by a group of women, and when she turns back to the mirror, she realizes she can’t see her reflection anymore.

This realization sets off a string of impromptu “La La Land”-esque dance moves — some of which are painfully awkward to watch.

About a minute and a half in, things get crazy: The singer whips off the bottom of her gown, revealing a sassy, shorter version of her fringy frock.

The weird dance moves and the dramatic disrobing aren’t even the most buzzed-about bits of the video, though. Critics say Swift’s video is a ripoff of Spike Jonze’s 2016 Kenzo commercial (starring “The Leftovers” actress Margaret Qualley).

“Anybody else notice that the @taylorswift13 ‘Delicate’ music video ripped off Spike Jonze’s Kenzo video? It’s almost beat-for-beat, just with worse dancing,” one whistleblower tweets.

“Taylor Swift’s ‘Delicate’ video is a poor man’s version of Spike Jonze’s ad for Kenzo,” tweets another.

Naturally, Swift’s die-hard fans couldn’t care less about the Kenzo controversy.

“@taylorswift13 dancing in a storm in her best dress because she’s fearless and it doesn’t get better than this in the ‘Delicate’ video is everything,” tweets a loyalist.

On their first royal tour as a married couple, the newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex set out to greet, well, just about everyone. In between handshakes at Dublin’s Croke Park July 11, Duchess Meghan allowed 3-year-old Walter Cullen to pet her cheek while husband Prince Harry let Dylan Mahon, 4, touch his beard. The duo, says a source in the new issue of Us Weekly, “enjoy every opportunity to interact and spend time with locals.” And though their stay was short — just two days — it ignited their desire to travel.

Before Harry, 33, and the former Suits star, 36, begin packing for their October tour of Australia and New Zealand, they are already laying the groundwork for another trip in the spring of 2019 — this time, to her native country. “They are so excited to head to the U.S.,” reveals a palace insider, noting it will be their first trip to the States since their May vows. “Meghan is looking forward to introducing Harry to everything she loves about the U.S.”

Her favorites range from coast to coast. Though there is no official itinerary yet, “they are thinking New York, Washington, D.C., and California,” says the insider. “They’re working to finalize locations and venues.” Their goal, however, is set. “Meghan and Harry want to solidify ties between the U.K. and the U.S.,” continues the source. “They want to highlight and foster these relationships.”

They’re open to possibilities, too. Other potential stops include visits to Chicago’s Obama Foundation — “President and Mrs. Obama have been stalwart supporters,” says the insider — as well as Canada. Adds the insider, “The Canadian Foreign Office has heard about the tour and would love to have them stop there. This may very well become a North American tour.”

206,"Brad Pitt is ‘quietly dating’ as he has ‘secret meeting’ with Jennifer Aniston Brad has been back on the scene, apparently (picture: Shutterstock)

Brad Pitt and wife Angelina Jolie announced their split in September 2016, however reports have emerged old mate Pitt has been ‘quietly dating’ since rejoining the single sphere.

It comes as he apparently also enjoyed a ‘secret meeting’ with ex-wife Jennifer Aniston, following her split with Justin Theroux.

There’s so much to unpack here.

Anyway, according to Entertainment Tonight, Brad has been dating women ‘not in the public eye’ as he tried to keep his private life just that.

A source explained to the website: ‘He’s very private about who he’s seeing, but he does continue to casually date.’

The insider told Entertainment Tonight the father-of-six – Shiloh, 11, Maddox, 16, Vivienne, nine, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, and Knox, nine – has ‘made changes in his life’ since he and Ange parted ways.

‘When they first split he spent a lot of time at home and was often very down about what was going on. He was a homebody for many months, but in the last month or two, he’s been going out more,’ they said. ‘He enjoys going out to eat with close friends.’

Sounds like a blast.

The publication added: ‘He is in no way ready to get serious with anyone. He invites his dates over to his house and never takes women out in public. While it’s been a year and a half [after their split], it still feels too soon to him.’

It comes following this reported secret rendezvouz with Jen that reportedly also had Brad’s mother quite excited.

It was reported last week that the pair had enjoyed a ‘secret meeting’ which was ‘very relaxed and low-key’ for a nice catch up.

A source claimed it ‘seemed just like old times, but better,’ according to US magazine Star.

An insider has now said his mum is all for the reunion, as she was always a big fan of Jen’s.

‘Brad‘s mom Jane has always had a soft spot for Jennifer, even after the divorce they kept in touch for years,’ they told HollywoodLife.com. ‘She hated the way things ended between Brad and Jen so it’s a big relief that they‘ve mended fences. She‘s so happy that they‘re back in touch.’

Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin

Rumors are rife that Hollywood superstars Brad Pitt and Sandra Bullock might be dating and that the budding relationship, if true, was nudged at by another big star and close friend to the two, George Clooney.

Months after the controversial separation that led to Angelina Jolie filing for divorce from Pitt, reports are swirling around that Pitt might just be on the road of moving on with the help of the ""Ocean's Eight"" actress.

Back in September 2016, fans of Pitt and Jolie were deeply shocked after both camps confirmed that their marriage is not working anymore, thus the need for divorce due to ""irreconcilable differences."" Pitt and Jolie have been known as one of the most adored couples in Hollywood. They have been married since 2014 and have six children.

This month, the Australian paper New Idea claims that Pitt and Bullock have been ""discreetly"" going out in ""secret dates and private phone calls"" and the report maintains that the two are ""taking things 'to the next level.'""

""They've always moved in the same crowd but the timing has been wrong – either he's been with someone, or she has. But now they're finally free to take their chemistry to the next level,"" New Idea's unnamed source added.

The same New Idea report was also the one to spill that ""insiders confirm"" Clooney built up the grounds for Pitt and Bullock to start dating.

However, a recent report from PEOPLE magazine refutes the claims that Pitt is dating anybody. According to the publication, Pitt is savoring every moment of his single life and is not rushing to look for a new love.

On the other hand, PEOPLE's source shares that while Pitt is not dating anyone, the ""Allied"" actor has finally found the time to welcome back old friends to his life, which is one of the factors that have been helping him move on from the recent failed marriage with Jolie.

Aside from spending time with old friends and his kids, Pitt reportedly developed an affinity for sculpture while working on a lineup of movies which he will either star in or produce, PEOPLE adds.",0

As you may remember, Brad dived into an art project as a way of coping with his harsh divorce form Angelina Jolie, 41. “He also very much an artist in his own right,” the source says. “He spends quite a bit of time here. I think he feels a sense of comfort here because every one treats him like a regular person. He seems to like that.”

In addition to looking into some new digs, the superstar has been on the dating scene. “He has been dating a bit,” an insider revealed to People. “It’s not anything serious.” Phew! “He doesn’t have a girlfriend,” the source says. “He seems more comfortable double-dating…It’s more of a way to get out and be social.”

Good for him!

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in 2016 and are engaged in a custody battle for children - Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9. Recently, a judge handed out a new schedule ordering Angeline Jolie to give Brad Pitt more time with the kids.

This decision has left Angelina fuming, as per a report in Radar Online. Angelina is now determined to expose details of the infamous fight that led to their separation in 2016.

“Angie’s going to paint her life with Brad as a living hell. She’s told friends she’s kept a vivid account of Brad’s boozing, violent rages and volatile behavior. The way things are shaping up, she’ll have no option but to pull out the diary if she wants to win this custody battle,” a source told Radar Online.

“Nobody outside the family, the flight crew and the feds know what went down, but Angie will make it known in her journal. Angie has said the diary will be very damaging to Brad’s custody hopes. She’s calling it her trump card,” the insider revealed.

While the article appears to have since been taken down, the news has spread like wildfire.

The rumours come after Cyrus deleted all of her Instagram posts last week.

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have reportedly called off their wedding yet again — and it's apparently because of a disagreement over when to have kids.

OK! Australia reportedly published the news on Thursday after a source told the site that 28-year-old Hemsworth was keen to become a dad, while 25-year-old Cyrus wasn't ready.

While the article appears to have since been taken down, the news has spread like wildfire and has since been reported by the likes of The Daily Mail, The Sun, and the Evening Standard.

According the the Mail, the source told OK!: ""He wants kids and doesn't want to keep putting it off but it's not quite the timeline Miley had in mind… he is left heartbroken.

""Miley put off plans for the wedding and Liam was growing tired of it… they haven't been getting along in recent months.

""[She] didn't really want to get married. It's something that everyone else seemed to get but Liam. [His] family had been begging him to see the light for a long time, but he had faith in Miley. Now he feels like an idiot.""

Cyrus sparked attention when she deleted all of her Instagram posts last week.

While fans speculated it might mean new music is on the way, it's possible it may have had as much to do with her relationship troubles.

These were taken last night in West Hollywood, and Seth and Charlize came out of a sushi place. Note how Charlize is hiding her face in some of these pics? Do you think that’s just her natural reticence or is she actually shame-dating Seth and she doesn’t want people to know? My general thought on Charlize is that she would never shame-date someone. If Charlize is going to take the trouble to bang you, she doesn’t mind if people know. More likely she’s hiding her face because she just didn’t want to be photographed at that moment or whatever. And whatever she has going with Seth is barely a month old, so it is a little early to be so public, you know? You can see more photos of Seth and Charlize here.",0

218,"Scott Disick Hires Fake Artist to Prank Kris Jenner as Revenge for 'Art Shaming' Khloe Kardashian Scott Disick is sticking up for Khloe Kardashian.

In a sneak peek clip from an all-new episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the 35-year-old reality star pulls a prank on Kris Jenner after Khloe claims she was art shamed by her famous momager.

Scott meets up with an actor named Richardson Jones, who he hires to play ""very famous artist"" Art Vandelay, a person made up by George Costanza on Seinfeld.

""Today will be the day that we introduce Kris to this artist,"" Scott explains. ""Hopefully everything goes well and she falls for it.""

""You have to remember here, this guy has absolutely no knowledge of art,"" he adds. ""The only thing he knows is how to basically pretend that he knows.""

When Kris arrives, Scott introduces her to Art immediately.

""You're name is Art? And you're in an art gallery? And you're an artist?"" she asks. ""This is amazing!""

Trying to connect with her new artist pal, she then asks, ""Are you going to Art Basel again this year?"" to which he responded, ""Absolutely.""

In case you missed it, in another clip released earlier this week, Khloe accuses her mom of ""art shaming"" her when Kris suggests she go to an art class after she inquires about a piece of artwork in Kris' office.

""Just because I'm not as knowledgeable as you, you shouldn't turn your nose up,"" Khloe argues. ""You should be like, 'Well Khloe, Jeff Koons is…' instead of making me feel less than and uneducated.""

""You can't art shame people just because they know less than you,"" she continues. ""I'm your f**king daughter and you're art shaming me and it's mean.""

Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on E! In the meantime, watch the video below to hear the nicer things Kris has said about her daughter in a recent interview with ET.

Jon Cryer, who starred alongside Stanton in 1986’s “Pretty in Pink,” posted a photo of the two on set with the caption, “Was an honor, man. #RIPHarryDeanStanton”

“Baby Driver” director Edgar Wright also shared a still of Stanton from “Repo Man” with the caption, “RIP to the legendary Harry Dean Stanton. Impossible to cover his legacy in brief but here’s a few favs: ‘Alien,’ ‘Paris Texas,’ ‘Repo Man.'”

Longtime Stanton collaborator David Lynch, who most recently worked with him on the “Twin Peaks” revival, released a statement, writing, “The great Harry Dean Stanton has left us. There went a great one. There’s nobody like Harry Dean. Everyone loved him. And with good reason. He was a great actor (actually beyond great) – and a great human being – so great to be around him!!! You are really going to be missed Harry Dean!!! Loads of love to you wherever you are now!!!“

Director Monte Hellman made “Ride in the Whirlwind” (1966), “Two Lane Blacktop” (1971), and “Cockfighter” (1974) with Stanton. He told Variety that he met Stanton through Jack Nicholson “back when they were roommates.” Hellman said that Stanton “had the same quality as all great actors and I think Harry summed it up best himself when he told me some advice Jack had given him. It was ‘Let the wardrobe do the acting.’ He was one of a kind and he didn’t have a bad angle. You could him up, down, left, right and he always looked great. He did have an actor’s ego and did want to garner more lead roles. I remember on ‘Two Lane Blacktop’ he thought he should have been cast in the Warren Oates part. He was also very upset when he discovered, on location in Oklahoma, that the character was a gay hitchhiker. This was 1970 and he was a little bit old-fashioned in his thinking then. Actually, he was so pissed off, he almost quit. But then he delivered what I believe is one of the most moving performances of his life.”

Shawn Doyle, who acted with Stanton in “Big Love,” tweeted a tribute. “You could watch him on set say a line as simple as ‘hello,’ and be mystified why it was so friggin compelling.”

220,"Leonardo DiCaprio Star in, Produce ‘The Black Hand’ – Variety Leonardo DiCaprio will star in and produce an adaptation of Stephan Talty’s book “The Black Hand” for Paramount Pictures.

The true story about the origins of the mafia in America follows Joe Petrosino — nicknamed the “Italian Sherlock Holmes” — an NYPD cop who goes after the ruthless gang in the early 190os. The thugs (with the calling card black hand) migrated from Italy to America, and kidnapped people to extort money from their families. They were loathed by law-abiding Italian families who were frightened, but nevertheless helped Petrosino behind the scenes.

Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Jeremy Bell of The Gotham Group will produce. DiCaprio’s producing partner, Jennifer Davisson, will also produce with Gotham, as well as Nathaniel Posey on behalf of his Appian Way Productions.

Talty is the New York Times-bestselling author of six nonfiction books focused on history and individual achievement. As a ghostwriter, Talty’s work includes “A Captain’s Duty,” which was the basis for the 2013 Oscar-nominated Tom Hanks-starrer “Captain Phillips.”

DiCaprio recently starred in “Before the Flood,” the 2016 documentary about climate change directed by Fisher Stevens. He will next play Sam Phillips, a pioneer in the music industry during the 1950s who helped launch the careers of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis.

Paramount has been busy acquiring material for DiCaprio following his new first-look deal, which he signed in 2015. Appain Way is developing a reboot of the “Captain Planet” series with Glen Powell, among its many projects.

DiCaprio is repped by LBI Entertainment. The news was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.",0
221,"Kourtney Kardashian Reportedly Pregnant With Baby #4 — Is Ex-BF Younes Bendjima The Dad? A shocking new report claims Kourtney Kardashian’s pregnant again — and they have a theory as to who the father may be! Is it her ex, Younes Bendjima?



Here’s another plot twist in Kourtney Kardashian’s love life. The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with “what appeared to be a bump” in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! “It was strange to see because she’s usually so perfectly svelte,” a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, “Everyone is whispering that she’s pregnant with her fourth child.” If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it’s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney’s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney’s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim — it’s more than likely Scott!

“They’ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,” the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 – but reportedly, that was not on Scott’s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a “recent” trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! “They made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,” the source said before adding, “Everyone is buzzing that she’s carrying Scott’s baby.” As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven’t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn’t fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because “all of their kids came out beautifully.”

And apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren’t together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney’s alleged baby bump wasn’t just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone’s stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly “isn’t sure how to handle this situation.” The friend added that Kourtney “isn’t saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she’s been spending time with…it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner’s] management skills to straighten out this mess!”

Maybe this report isn’t so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum – it’s her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? “[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,” our source told us. “So if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.”

222,"No, In Touch, Megyn Kelly is Not Replacing Matt Lauer on Today Gossip Cop today debunked a tabloid cover story claiming that Megyn Kelly is replacing Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show.

In Touch’s latest cover features a headline screaming “Shakeup At The ‘Today Show’: Matt Replaced By Megyn,” along with a dubious story alleging betrayal and backstabbing between the two television heavy-hitters.

Yet the piece “appears to be wholly manufactured by the publication,” according to Mediaite‘s sister site Gossip Cop.

What’s more, the tabloid offers up some fairly outrageous evidence to support its story, claiming Kelly showed up Lauer by nabbing a joint interview with President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It’s fairly safe to assume Trump will not be joining Putin on a love seat for for a tell-all with Megyn Kelly anytime soon, as much as we would like to will that into existence.

Lauer, Gossip Cop reports, will continue to be the face of Today and a key fixture at NBC News despite the arrival of Kelly, which is currently slated for June.

From the report:

The notion that Lauer has been “replaced,” says an extremely well-placed NBC News insider, is “totally false.” And as for the contention that there will be a joint Putin and Trump interview, and that it will be conducted by Kelly, our impeccable source calls it “laughable.”

In Touch has published a number of demonstrably false stories touting a feud between Lauer and Kelly, including another cover story from February alleging Lauer was going to be “dumped” at the Today show in favor of the former Fox News star.

Last September, when she was still at Fox, Kelly––who said she’s friends with Lauer and respects him a lot––defended him after he got criticism in the liberal media for not being tough enough on Donald Trump during that NBC News presidential forum.

As much of the country is tracking the arrival of Hurricane Harvey, the Trump administration has taken the term “Friday news dump” to a new level — and the president is getting ripped for it.

Around 8 p.m. ET, the White House announced that Trump granted a presidential pardon to former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Announced two days after the president’s rally in Phoenix, the pardon comes before Arpaio, who spoke at last year’s Republican National Convention, has even been sentenced following his July conviction of criminal contempt for disregarding a court order in a racial profiling case. In defense of the move, the administration is citing Arpaio’s long history of military and law enforcement service.

The Arpaio pardon comes on the heels of Trump officially putting into place his ban of transgender people serving in the military, and simultaneously, as controversial White House aide Sebastian Gorka resigned.

Many celebrities and political figures strongly criticized the moves and their timing on social media, calling the president a “racist,” “monster,” and “disgusting.”

“Transgender Ban & Arpaio pardon on the same day, hiding behind the news of Hurricane Harvey,” tweeted House of Cards creator Beau Willimon. “@realDonaldTrump is a hateful, cowardly menace.”

225,"Is it true that Prince Charles would need to change his name if he ever became King of England, due to the misfortunes of previous King Charles''? YESTERYEAR



Is it true that Prince Charles would need to change his name if he ever became King of England, due to the misfortunes of previous King Charles'? Rob Moseley, Loughborough Uni Charles II spent much of his time consorting with a very attractive, extremely buxom, young lady called Nell Gwynne. Maybe our present Charles would welcome such misfortune! David Vickery, Croydon, UK My understanding is that upon accession the Monarch is entitled to be crowned as, and therefore known by, any name (s)he chooses. Hence King George VI (real name, I think, Albert, or Bertie), similarly King Edward VII's real name was I think Albert and King George V's real name was David. The last one does sound a bit unlikely, but I seem to remember reading it somewhere. Similarly, since the death of big bad much maligned Richard III, no-one seems to have been particularly keen to use the name Richard. On the other hand, each royal house has tended to have its preferred first names, so maybe we shouldn't read too much into these things. To answer the question, I don't think Prince Charles would have to change his name but he could if he wanted. Any suggestions for possible names? Cathy, London, UK He wouldn't need to but he could choose to. His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George and he can use whichever one he wants to. Since the last 2 Charleses weren't the greatest kings we've ever had he has said he will be styled George VII should he become King. Matt Stephenson, London, UK Edward VII was christened Albert Edward; George V was George Frederick Ernest Albert; Edward VIII was Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David but he was known as David (wouldn't you want to be with a name like that); George VI was Albert Frederick Arthur George and known as Bertie. As for Charles, what about King Arthur (II)? Graham Ralph, Gravesend, UK 'King Ian' has a nice ring to it... Lara, Bath The answer to the question is no. Charles Philip Arthur George has speculated that he may use his last given name. But remember, Edward VII and George VI, when christened, were not expected to succeed to the throne, as they had elder brothers, Charles was christened in full expectation that he would one day be king. I can't help hoping he will take Arthur as his regnal name. It would sneak one up on fate, which has denied us three Arthurs already - the heirs of Henry II, Henry VII and Victoria were all called Arthur, but never succeeded to the throne. Quentin Langley, Woking UK Queen Victoria did indeed have a son called Arthur but he was not her eldest son and not her heir. He lived well into adulthood and had children of his own. Susan Deal, Sheffield UK No. He would not be required to adopt a different regnal name but, as Matt Stephenson surmises, he probably would. My understanding is that he is happy enough with Charles as a 'personal' name, but that it too redolent of the accursed House of Stuart to be aceptable for regnal purposes. As for his other given names, his relationship with his father is hardly such that he would want to perpetuate him as King Philip (which anyway would be a bit rich as the son of Queen Elizabeth), and although he is a bit barmy, he is not (here I disagree with Quentin Langley) quite barmy enough to want to be King Arthur: can't we imagine the mick-taking that would arise? Would Camilla be the Lady of the Lake, and who would be his Merlin? That leaves the traditional choice of ""George VII"": boring and conventional - but what do we expect of the Hanoverians?

226,"Justin Theroux Found Post-Its From Brad Pitt During Jen Aniston Marriage Fans have always longed for ’90s golden couple Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to get back together — something Justin Theroux became keenly aware of two years ago when he found love notes Aniston had saved from the heartthrob, a source recalls in the new issue of Us Weekly.

“He stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” a source tells Us. “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already.’”

The source explains that impact of those little notes was huge. “Jen assured him they weren’t a big deal, but Justin wasn’t thrilled … Justin had moments of insecurity like that.”

As previously reported, Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, announced their separation on Thursday, February 15, via a joint statement: “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”

The duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux’s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005. He infamously moved on from the Friends alum with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar, Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie, who share Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11 and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, called it quits in September 2016 after two years of marriage and 12 years together.

“Jen has struggled with the perception that she is this pathetic woman after the divorce from Brad,” the insider tells Us. “It played a role in her wanting to marry Justin.”

227,"Katy Perry slams Lionel Richie on Jimmy Kimmel Live! It appears there's drama at the American Idol judges table already.

Katy Perry, who will be joined by Luke Bryant and Lionel Richie in hosting the revamped competition series, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday to promote the show. During the appearance she told host Jimmy Kimmel she and Luke are thick as thieves, but it seems there's a rift between them and their 68-year-old co-judge.

'We respect him just about as much as his kids respect him. Which is not a lot,' the Roar singer said while appearing on the late night show.

Katy Perry fired shots at American Idol co-host Lionel Richie during Jimmy Kimmel Live!

The comment appears to refer to something the musician previously made about his youngest daughter, Sofia Richie, dating Scott Disick. It's been widely reported that Lionel doesn't approve of his 19-year-old daughter's relationship with the troubled 34-year-old.

Katy's jabs didn't stop there, however. Speaking with the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host she nitpicked the way Lionel critiques American Idol contestants. The award-winning musician said Lionel often recalls working with music legends in long-winded stories comparable to 'Ted Talks'.

Katy doesn't just make snide remarks behind Lionel's back, though. She and her country musician co-judge, Luke, have been known to play a prank or two on the legendary musician, according to her Jimmy Kimmel appearance. She revealed on the show that they put whoopee cushions on his seat when he stands up to provide feedback to competitors.

'We're ruining his legacy,' she said.

Before American Idol fans get too bummed about this on-set beef, it's worth noting that Katy also said during her appearance that Lionel is actually like 'an uncle' to her and her fellow judge.

'He's an uncle you want in your house telling you all these wonderful historical stories and he does have some tea but we can't put that on TV,' she said.

Although there may be no actual feud on the set of American Idol, there's plenty of other drama rumored to be going down behind the judging table.

According to TMZ, Katy's left American Idol executives 'frustrated' with her repeated late arrivals on the set during auditions. Per the publication's report, she's 'almost always late' by about 10 or 15 minutes.

Producers are also said to be worried about a lack of 'comedic tension' on the show. The outlet reported that the panel are 'not at each other's throats, either in a serious or runny way', which has created worries about ratings.

228,"Jennifer Lopez Not to be confused with the meteorologist Jennifer Lopez

Jennifer Lynn López[2] (born July 24, 1969) is an American actress, singer, dancer and producer. In 1991, López began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 Selena biopic of the same name, López received a Golden Globe nomination and became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.[3]

López ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music.[4] With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner in 2001, López became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album This Is Me... Then, and appeared in Maid in Manhattan.

After starring in Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure, López subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol, and released her seventh studio album Love?. In 2016, she began starring in the crime drama series Shades of Blue and commenced a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on World of Dance.

With a cumulative film gross of US$3 billion and estimated global sales of 80 million records, López is regarded as the most influential Latin performer in the United States. In 2012, Forbes ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world.[5] Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 include: ""If You Had My Love"", ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"", ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"", ""Jenny from the Block"", ""All I Have"", and ""On the Floor"", which is one of the best-selling singles of all time.[6] For her contributions to the music industry, López has received a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Billboard Icon Award and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award among other honors. Her other ventures include clothing lines, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation.

Early life

Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969,[7] in The Bronx borough of New York City,[8] to Puerto Rican parents[2] Guadalupe Rodríguez[9] and David López.[10] She has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda, a journalist.[11] David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.[12] At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home—singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay ""out of trouble"".[13] Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School.[14] In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level, and was a member of the school's softball team.[15] She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.[13]

While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.[16] Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a ""famous movie star"". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a ""really stupid"" idea and that ""no Latinos did that"". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a Golden Musicals of Broadway, which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer, and choreographer.[12]

Career

1991–1996: Career beginnings

Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the New Kids on the Block in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of ""Games"" at the 18th Annual American Music Awards.[17] Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television program In Living Color. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993, when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist Janet Jackson.[18] Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but backed out as she wanted to do her ""own thing"".[19]

Lopez received her first professional acting gig in the direct-to-video drama film Lost in the Wild (1993), co-starring with Lindsay Wagner and Robert Loggia.[20] Later in 1993, Lopez signed a deal with CBS to co-star in the television series Second Chances. Lopez received her first major big-screen role in Gregory Nava's 1995 drama My Family portraying Young Maria.[21] Although her role was uncredited, Lopez received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for her performance.[21] In November 1995, Lopez starred in Money Train alongside Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson as New York City transit cops. In August 1996, Lopez had a supporting role in the comedy Jack.[22]

1997–1999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6

In February 1997, Lopez starred alongside Jack Nicholson and Stephen Dorff in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine.[23] Lopez starred as the title role of the Selena biopic of the same name in March.[24] Despite having previously worked with the film's director on My Family, Lopez was subjected to an intense auditioning process before she was cast in the film.[25] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that even in the ""forgettable films"" Money Train, and Jack, Lopez's ""presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom"" and with Selena she's ""seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers"". He concluded by calling the film not just a celebration of Selena's life, but also of the actress who portrayed her.[26] The announcement was described as the ""role of a lifetime."" from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million,[27][28] which made Lopez the highest-paid Hispanic actress in history. After filming Selena, Lopez was ""really feeling [her] Latin roots"" and cut a demo in Spanish.[29] Lopez's manager then sent the song, titled ""Vivir Sin Ti"" (Living without You), to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead.[30]

In April, Lopez starred in the horror film Anaconda alongside Ice Cube and Jon Voight.[31] Lopez starred alongside Sean Penn and Billy Bob Thornton in the crime film U Turn in October. The film, which is based on the novel Stray Dogs by John Ridley, received somewhat positive reviews from critics.[32] In June, Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in Out of Sight, Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name (1996).[33] Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, Lopez won rave reviews for her performance.[34] Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the computer-animated film Antz in October.[35]

Lopez's debut single, ""If You Had My Love"", was released in May 1999, as she began to ready her first album.[36][37] Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single ""...Baby One More Time"" four months prior.[38] During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent.[39] Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: ""If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.""[40] ""Waiting for Tonight"", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez's best song.[41] Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the ""popular actor even more popular"". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by ""this woman who seemed to have so many different talents"".[40] By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.[42] She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).[38]

2000–2002: Film success, J.Lo and This Is Me... Then

On February 23, 2000, Lopez, accompanied by then boyfriend Sean Combs, wore a plunging exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress on the red carpet of the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. The dress ""had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again,"" exposing her midriff and then as cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe.[43] The dress generated controversy and media attention, with images of Lopez in the dress being downloaded from the Grammy website over half a million times 24 hours after the event.[44] Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage, declaring that she had no idea ""it was going to become such a big deal"".[45] Lopez returned to the big-screen in August, starring in the psychological thriller The Cell opposite Vincent D'Onofrio.[46]

During the process of recording her second album, Lopez decided to tweak her image as she began to develop into a sex symbol. She started going by J.Lo, something fans often called her.[47] She subsequently named the album J.Lo. Released on January 23, 2001, it was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200.[48] During the same week, her romantic comedy film The Wedding Planner in which she starred opposite Matthew McConaughey opened atop the box office. This made her the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in the United States.[49] The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"", which reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was followed by the single ""Play"".[50] In April 2001, Lopez launched J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez, her own clothing and accessory company. Lopez felt that ""the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored"" in the fashion industry, and therefore her company specialized in clothing women of all shapes.[47] The following month, she starred in the romantic drama film Angel Eyes, which performed disappointingly at the box office and generated mixed reviews.[51] After several months, J.Lo was declining on the charts; this prompted Mottola to recruit rapper Ja Rule to create an urban-oriented remix of the song ""I'm Real"". This led to the release of ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", which quickly reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Its success resulted in J.Lo being reissued to include the single, which was number one in the United States during the week of the September 11 attacks.[50] J.Lo became the best-selling album of Lopez's career, having sold 3.8 million copies in the US and moved over 12 million units worldwide.[52][53]

Having redefined Lopez's sound with ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", Epic decided to release further remixes in order to ""keep the momentum going"".[54] A remix album entitled J to tha L–O! The Remixes was subsequently released on February 5, 2002. It debuted at the summit of the Billboard 200, making it the first remix album to do so. Its lead single, ""Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)"", featuring Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah, reached number one in the US.[55] J to tha L–O! The Remixes became one of the best-selling remix albums of all time, selling 1.5 million copies in the US.[56] It produced two more singles: ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" and ""Alive"", a ballad co-written by her husband at the time, Cris Judd. In April 2002, Lopez opened her restaurant, Madrè's.[47] The following month, she starred in the thriller film Enough, which was described by the Boston Herald as a ""kick-but, female empowerment"" film.[57] While filming Enough, which required an overworked Lopez to practice Krav Maga, she suffered a nervous breakdown. She recalled feeling ""sick and weird"", refusing therapeutic help or medication. She confessed, ""I was like – I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything.""[58] In September, she released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo. It performed strongly despite predictions that it would fail, and became the top-selling fragrance in the US.[59]

Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then, was released on November 25, 2002. It was dedicated to actor Ben Affleck, her fiancé at the time. The album's lead single ""Jenny from the Block"", was later described by Sam Lansky of MTV News as her most iconic single.[60] In the song, Lopez ""intones her modest childhood roots"".[61] The album itself performed strongly, selling 2.6 million copies in the US.[56] Its second single, ""All I Have"", peaked at number one in the US. That December, Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, which became the highest-grossing film of her career.[62]

2003–2005: Gigli and Rebirth

In August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli. The film was a box office bomb, and is considered one of the worst films of all time. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film.[62][63] Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying ""[It] was very tough"", ""the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment.""[64] In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, Still Jennifer Lopez. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by Andy Hilfiger as a ""more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede.""[65] Lopez's clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.[49]

In March 2004, Lopez had a minor role in the film Jersey Girl, alongside Affleck. Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple's break-up, it was noted that ""they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come"".[66] In October, Lopez co-starred alongside Richard Gere in the drama Shall We Dance?, a re-make of the 1996 Japanese film of the same title. The film was successful at the box office, and was considered a rebound for Lopez following Gigli.[62]

After placing her career on hiatus, Lopez released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth ""came about because I was on such a roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [when] I came back, this was the first project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn.""[67] Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after ""fawning"" over Affleck on This Is Me... Then"", Lopez ""wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight"" on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks.[68] The album produced the single ""Get Right"", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom.[69] In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15 million.[70] The film's marketing played up Lopez's ""Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image"", and it became a box office success.[62][71] In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.

2006–2009: Career disappointments and Como Ama una Mujer

Lopez in 2008

In April 2006, Lopez reappeared on the Billboard Hot 100 as a featured artist on ""Control Myself"", the lead single from LL Cool J's twelfth studio album Todd Smith. The song peaked at number four on the chart following its release as a music download, making it the pair's second collaboration to reach the top five.[72] Bordertown, a film based on the Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, made its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006. Lopez, who also acts as the film's producer, stars as Lauren Adrian, an American news reporter for the Chicago Sentinel who wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war.[73] Bordertown received a direct-to-video release.[62] DanceLife, a reality series following the lives of seven dancers trying to break into the world of professional dance, aired on MTV from January 15 to March 5, 2007. Lopez produced, created and was featured in the show.[74] According to the album's co-producer Estéfano, Lopez's fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer would ""prove critics wrong"" with its ""big songs that require a voice""; referring to the criticism of Lopez having a ""limited"" vocal tone. The album's lead single ""Qué Hiciste"" reached number one on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. Lopez performed the song on the sixth season of American Idol on April 11, 2007, becoming the first person to perform a Spanish song on the series.[69] The album received the highest first-week sales in the United States for a debut Spanish album and the highest digital sales.[77][78]

In September 2007, Lopez starred in the biographical film El Cantante, which is based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe. In the film, Lavoe is portrayed by then-husband Marc Anthony while Lopez plays Lavoe's wife Puchi.[79] Lopez revealed that she felt her performance in the film El Cantante should have earned her an Oscar.[80] ""I feel like I had that [Oscar worthy role] in 'El Cantante,' but I don't think the academy members saw it"".[80] El Cantante did not perform well at the box office, earning just $7.6 million.[62] Lopez performed the song ""Toma de Mí"" for the films soundtrack. Lopez and Anthony also launched their co-headlining North American concert tour on September 28.[81] Lopez's sixth studio album Brave, released in October, was her lowest-charting album worldwide.[82] The album produced two singles, ""Do It Well"" and ""Hold It Don't Drop It"". The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to make any significant impact on the charts. A five-part miniseries, Jennifer Lopez Presents: Como Ama una Mujer, based on the lyrics of Como Ama una Mujer aired on Univision from October 30 to November 27, 2007. She placed her career on hiatus after giving birth to twins in February 2008.[83] In late 2009, Lopez released two songs for her seventh studio album, Love? (""Louboutins"" and ""Fresh Out of the Oven""); however, the songs failed to make an appearance on the Billboard charts which led to her departure from Epic Records.[84]

2010–2012: Career rejuvenation with American Idol and touring

Lopez parted ways with Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release her seventh studio album Love? under a new label.[85] Her departure from the label temporarily halted production on the album, which commenced in 2009. Upon signing a new contract with Island Records, recording resumed on the album.[86] The New York Daily News revealed that Lopez would be taking some of the records recorded under Sony Music Entertainment to her new label so that they could be included on the album.[87] In April, Lopez starred in the romantic comedy The Back-up Plan, her first theatrical role in three years.[83] In June, following the departure of Ellen DeGeneres from American Idol, it was reported that Lopez was in talks to join season ten's judging panel.[88][89][90] During this same time, Lopez and Anthony were being considered for a role on The X Factor for their appeal to Latin and International markets.[91] It was officially announced in September that Lopez would be joining the tenth season of American Idol. MTV stated that the deal was ""mutually beneficial to all those involved"", while CNN reported that Lopez was viewing it as a decision to revive her career, while American Idol producers believed that Lopez and Steven Tyler's appointments would strengthen viewing figures.[92] In October, Lopez released her fourteenth fragrance, Love and Glamour. The perfume was inspired by Lopez's forthcoming ""return to the spotlight"".[93]

L'Oreal Paris named Lopez their new Global Ambassador and the face of their brands, including EverPure hair care, Preference hair color and Youth Code skin care. Her EverSleek hair care ads made their debut in early 2011, to coincide with the release of Love? and her debut as a judge on American Idol.[94] To further promote her comeback, in February, Venus chose Lopez as their new Global Ambassador.[95] Lopez's comeback single ""On the Floor"" was released later that same month. The song topped the charts across the globe, becoming one of the most successful singles of the year.[96] The song also became her highest charting single commercially as a lead artist, as well as her most successful airplay hit on contemporary hit radio, since ""Jenny from the Block"".[97] Love?, which was released in May, was a moderate commercial success, and was viewed as a humble comeback from Lopez, as many had considered her recording career over.[82] Lopez launched her next fragrance Love and Light in July, exclusively on HSN. 51,000 bottles of the fragrance were sold at its premiere, becoming Lopez's most successful fragrance launch to date, making over $2.9 million.[98] In September, Lopez launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection, a clothing and accessories line for Kohl's with Tommy Hilfiger.[99] In addition to the clothing line, she also launched the Jennifer Lopez Home Collection, featuring bedding, towels and luggage.[100] Later that same month Fiat, an Italian automobile manufacturer, enlisted Lopez to promote their products, including the 2012 Fiat 500 Cabrio.

In addition, she founded the mobile phone retail brand Viva Móvil, which is catered specifically for Latinos.[120] She lobbied for more Hispanic diversity on television,[121] hoping to empower the Latin community in these media ventures, stating: ""There's a big revolution going on, it's like a media and cultural revolution of Latinos here in the United States. We're realizing our power. We're realizing that we matter here.""[122] Inspired by her gay aunt who had recently died, Lopez signed on as executive producer of the television series The Fosters, which is about a same-sex couple raising a family.[123] The show premiered on ABC Family on June 3, 2013, and has since been a ratings success for the network.[124] Later that June, Lopez performed at the birthday of Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov.[125] Doing so, she garnered widespread backlash for performing for the leader of a ""repressive, authoritarian regime"".

Lopez is set to star in and executive produce Hustlers (2019), directed by Lorene Scafaria, for STX Entertainment, inspired by a New York article by Jessica Pressler, entitled ""The Hustlers at Scores"".[178][179] She is also attached to star as drug lord Griselda Blanco in a television film for HBO, which will focus on the ""rise and fall"" of Blanco. She will once more serve as an executive producer for the film, which is currently in development.[180] As an executive producer, Lopez is also developing an untitled legal drama for CBS and futuristic drama series entitled C.R.I.S.P.R. for NBC.[181]

Personal life

Lopez's personal life has attracted widespread media attention.[182] From February 22, 1997, to January 1998, she was married to Cuban waiter Ojani Noa.[183] Since their brief marriage, Lopez has endured many legal troubles regarding her relationship with Noa. In April 2006, she sued to prevent him from publishing a book about their marriage, contending that it violated their confidentiality agreement.[184] The following year, a court-appointed arbitrator issued a permanent injunction forbidding Noa from ""criticizing, denigrating, casting in a negative light or otherwise disparaging"" Lopez. She was awarded $545,000 in compensatory damages and Noa was ordered to hand over all copies of materials related to the book to Lopez or her attorney.[185] A lawsuit regarding a compromising private honeymoon video in Noa's possession is presently running.[186]

While working on her first album, On the 6, Lopez began dating record producer and rapper Sean Combs. On December 27, 1999, the couple was arrested along with two others in connection with a shooting outside the Times Square Club in New York. They were charged with criminal possession of a weapon as well as stolen property. Lopez was soon exonerated, having had nothing to do with the crime.[187] However, Combs was charged and indicted by a Manhattan grand jury.[188] After leaving Combs, Lopez developed a relationship with former back-up dancer Cris Judd, to whom she was married from September 29, 2001, to June 2002.[189] Following her second divorce due to irreconcilable differences, she commenced a high-profile relationship with actor and director Ben Affleck, to whom she became engaged in November 2002.[190][191] The media began to refer to them as ""Bennifer"", and they became a prominent supercouple in the media and popular culture. Bennifer became a popular term, which was eventually entered into urban dictionaries and neologism dictionaries as notable,[192] as the name blend started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of their first names.[193] The couple postponed their nuptials indefinitely a day prior to the planned ceremony in September 2003, citing the media's interference with the event as the reason.[194]

Anthony and Lopez, 2006

Following her break-up with Affleck in January 2004, Lopez began dating her longtime friend, Marc Anthony (real name: Marco Antonio Muñiz). The couple wed that June,[195][196] and lived in Brookville, New York.[197] Two men attempted to ransom a private wedding video that was stolen from the couple for one million dollars; however, they were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of conspiracy, attempted grand larceny and possession of stolen property.[198] On November 7, 2007, during the final night of their co-headlining tour, Lopez and Anthony officially confirmed that they were expecting their first child.[199] The announcement ended months of speculation over the pregnancy.[200] Her father confirmed that the couple were expecting twins, revealing that it runs in the family: ""My sister also had twins, so it's a hereditary thing.""[201] Lopez, who is a Roman Catholic, has stated that her faith discouraged her from pursuing in vitro fertilization treatment while trying to get pregnant.[202]

Lopez gave birth to a son and a daughter in Long Island, New York, February 2008.[203][204] The twins were introduced in the March 11, 2008, issue of People, for which the magazine paid a reported $6 million; the photographs of the twins became the most expensive celebrity picture ever taken at the time.[205] Three years later in July 2011, the couple announced their split, with Anthony filing for divorce in April 2012.[206] Their divorce was finalized on June 16, 2014, with Lopez retaining primary physical custody of the two children.[207] On December 31, 2014, she legally changed her name back to Jennifer Lopez, dropping Anthony's last name (Muñiz).[208][209]

Lopez had an on-off relationship with her former backup dancer Casper Smart from October 2011 to August 2016.[210][211]

In February 2017, she began dating former New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez.[212][213] In March 2019, they announced their engagement.[214]

In March 2018, Lopez opened up about her own Me Too movement story of being sexually harassed by a director early on in her career, when she was asked to take her top off during one of her first films.[215][216] Lopez has also been an active advocate for the Time's Up movement.[217]

Philanthropy and political activism

Following the September 11 attacks, Lopez was heavily involved in charitable activities. Joining various other artists, she was featured on charitable singles such as ""What's Going On"" and ""El Ultimo Adios (The Last Goodbye)"", which benefited people affected by the tragedy.[218][219] One dollar from each ticket sold at Lopez and Anthony's co-headlining North American concert tour, which grossed an estimated $10 million, was donated to Run for Something Better—a charitable organization supporting physical fitness programs for children.[81][220] In February 2007, Lopez was honored with the Artists for Amnesty prize by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, for her work in the film Bordertown, which shed light on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. Lopez described it as ""one of the world's most shocking and disturbing, underreported crimes against humanity.""[221][222]

In 2009, Lopez launched the Lopez Family Foundation (originally known as the Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase the availability of healthcare for underprivileged women and children, offering a telemedicine program supported by a partnership with the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has led to the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.[223][224]

In December 2012, Lopez held a charity drive that would affect her three favorite charities: the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles as well as the American Red Cross, mainly benefiting victims of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of her home town, New York City.[225] In May 2015, she became the first national celebrity spokesperson for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation (BCCHF), appearing in a campaign entitled ""Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are"".[226] That September, Lopez was announced as the first Global Advocate for Girls and Women at the United Nations Foundation.[227] This role sees her mobilizing action to address challenges faced by girls and women around the world, including maternal health care programs, education and violence against women.[228] In September 2017, following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, Lopez announced that she would be donating $1 million from the proceeds of her Las Vegas residency to humanitarian aid for Puerto Rico.[229][230] Along with ex-husband Marc Anthony, she launched a humanitarian relief campaign entitled Somos Una Voz (English: We Are One Voice), an effort supported by various celebrities to rush supplies to areas affected by Hurricane Maria.[231] Lopez and Anthony presented a subsequent concert and telethon for disaster relief, ""One Voice: Somos Live!"", which raised over $35 million.[232] She was also among various artists featured on Lin-Manuel Miranda's charity single ""Almost Like Praying"" which benefits Puerto Rico.[233]

Lopez is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has raised millions of dollars for HIV/AIDS research.[234] In June 2013, amfAR presented Lopez with its humanitarian award for her philanthropic work.[234] That September, she was awarded the Ally for Equality award presented by the Human Rights Campaign, for her support of the LGBT community.[235] The following year, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award.[236] In July 2016, Lopez released a single entitled ""Love Make the World Go Round"", a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, which benefits victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.[237] She was also featured on the song ""Hands"" along with numerous other artists, also benefiting those affected by the Orlando shooting.[238] Among numerous other artists, Lopez signed an open letter from Billboard magazine to the United States Congress in 2016, which demanded action on gun control.[239]

Lopez endorsed President Barack Obama in his 2012 presidential campaign, speaking in television advertisements and attending a fundraising event for Obama in Paris.[240][241] She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, headlining a free concert in Florida in support of her that October.[241][242]

Artistry

Musical style

According to author Ed Morales in The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond (2003), Lopez's music explores the ""romantic innocence"" of Latin music, while strongly identifying with hip hop.[245] Growing up, she was influenced by Latin styles ranging from salsa to bachata, but it was the 1979 hip hop song ""Rapper's Delight"" by The Sugarhill Gang that she said changed her life.[246] Her debut album On the 6 fuses the influence of Latin music with R&B and hip hop, which Lopez described as Latin soul. To the contrary, Morales described it as ""state-of-the-art dance pop"".[247] Dee Lockett, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that songs such as ""Waiting for Tonight"" made Lopez ""arguably the leading artist in the dance-pop movement at the time"".[248] While primarily sung in English, she speaks in Spanish and asserts her Latin heritage throughout the album, which is apparent in the song ""Let's Get Loud"".[249][250][251] She has also recorded bilingual songs, including the Latin pop song ""Cariño"", for her second album J.Lo.[252] A departure from her previous albums, This Is Me... Then blends 1970s soul with ""streetwise"" hip hop.[253] ""Get Right"", from Rebirth, is built around a sample of ""Soul Power 74"" by Maceo and the Macks, and is characterized by a repetitive saxophone riff. The New York Times called it ""one of the year's most unusual R&B songs"" which sounded ""like nothing else on the radio"".[254]

Described as autobiographical,[255] much of Lopez's music has centered around the ""ups and downs"" of love.[256] The lyrical content of This Is Me... Then is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck, with the song ""Dear Ben"" being described as the album's ""glowing centerpiece"".[257] Her first full length Spanish-language album, Como Ama una Mujer features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing.[258] When explaining her seventh studio album Love?, Lopez stated: ""There's still so much to learn and that's why the question mark.""[256] Other recurrent themes in Lopez's music have included her upbringing in the Bronx[247][259] and women's empowerment.[260]

Lopez has been influenced by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand.[261][262] She credited Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration.[247] Critics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited,[263][264] and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining ""radio-friendly"".[265] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone observed: ""Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R&B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.""[266] Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice ""slight"" and wrote: ""Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style"".[267] Entertainment Weekly criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark ""husky-voiced voluptuousness"" she has in her films.[268] J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun regards Lopez as having a ""breathy"" stylistic range, but lacking personality.[269]

Dance and stage

Considered one of dance's ""greatest success stories"",[158] Lopez felt an emotional connection to dance since her youth, when she specialized in ballet, jazz and flamenco.[270][271] Her career commenced on the variety television sketch comedy series In Living Color, where she was a part of an ethnically diverse dance group known as the Fly Girls.[272] Janet Jackson, whom she briefly served as a backup dancer for, has been credited by Lopez as an inspiration for her own dance and videos.[273] In 2015, Refinery29 ranked Lopez at number two on ""11 Of Pop's Most Iconic Dancers"", behind Jackson.[274] Since beginning her own recording career, Lopez has become known for her body-emphasizing music videos, which often include dance routines.[275] Some of them have been the subject of controversy, including ""Jenny from the Block"", ""Dance Again"" and ""Booty"".[276][277] Her provocatively choreographed music video for ""If You Had My Love"" allowed Lopez to become a dominant figure on MTV networks worldwide.[278] Madeline Roth of MTV wrote: ""Her diverse videography encompasses some of the most memorable visuals of the 21st century"",[279] with Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos observing that her ""dancing skills and ability to toy with her own celebrity have made her videos an important part of the new millennium's pop canon.""[280]

On stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship and sex appeal,[281] and often includes costumes such as bodysuits as part of her performance.[282][283][284] Author Priscilla Peña Ovalle stated in Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who ""used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies"".[285] Troy Patterson of Entertainment Weekly also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, ""She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova.""[286] Her signature movements include ""clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations"".[287] While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez's Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously.[288][289][290] In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, Los Angeles Times writer Nolan Feeney remarked that her dancing is ""undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show"".[281]

Lopez's provocative stage performances have also drawn scrutiny at times. In May 2013, her performance on the finale of the television series Britain's Got Talent was deemed inappropriate for family-friendly television, and drew viewer complaints to Ofcom.[291][292] Following her controversial performance at the musical festival Mawazine in 2015, Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it ""indecent"" and ""disgraceful"", while an education group claimed that she ""disturbed public order and tarnished women's honor and respect"".[293]

Public image

Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: ""Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles ""I'm Real"" and ""Jenny From the Block"". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's not asking you to come hither.""[244] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: ""Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere."" Holloway noted her image to be ""a dash of ghetto fabulousness"" and ""middle-class respectability"" for mass appeal.[294] Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: ""Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth madre.""[295] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture.[296] Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a ""showbiz phenomenon"".[297]

Lopez is widely celebrated for her callipygian figure,[298] which was the inspiration for Sir Mix-a-Lot's 1992 hit ""Baby Got Back"".[299] She has been credited with influencing a change in mainstream female body image.[300] In Latin Sensations (2001), Herón Marquez wrote: ""Because she wasn't rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold and allowed millions of women to feel good about their bodies. Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.""[40] Vanity Fair described her buttocks as ""in and of themselves, a cultural icon"".[301] Details magazine named Lopez the ""Sexiest Woman of the Year"" in 1998,[302] and she led FHM's ""100 Sexiest Women"" list twice.[303] In 2011, she was named ""The Most Beautiful Woman"" by People.[304] The following year, VH1 ranked her the fourth on their list of ""100 Sexiest Artists"",[305] while Vibe magazine named her the most ""lustable"" celebrity of the past twenty years.[306] In 2014, Lopez stated, ""There's this funny notion in America that you can't be a mom and be sexy (...) It's the craziest thing I've ever heard... The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.""[133]

Lopez is a tabloid fixture[307][308] and has admitted to having a ""less-than-perfect"" public image.[309] The media often draw comparisons between Lopez and actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships.[310][311] In fact, Lopez has been dubbed a ""modern-day Liz Taylor"" by the media.[312] Lynn Hirschberg of W compared her glamorous public persona to that of Taylor.[313] Her style is described by Billboard's Lauren Savage as scantily clad.[314] Lopez has been criticized by the animal rights organization PETA for inclusion of fur in her fashion lines and outfits.[315] She has received a bad reputation as being a demanding ""diva"",[316] but she constantly refutes this.[317] In 2003, The Observer remarked that Lopez was ""the woman immortalised in a million headlines as 'Hollywood's most demanding diva' ... Lopez must wonder what heinous crime she has committed to become the most vilified woman in modern popular culture.""[318]

Legacy and cultural impact

Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry.[15][319] In 1999, The Record newspaper observed that she was responsible for the introduction of a Latina presence in the film industry, which was a ""whites-only preserve"" for much of its history.[320] Described as a ""multidimensional artist who had turned into a financial powerhouse"",[321] Lopez became the highest-paid actress of Hispanic descent in history.[322] Miriam Jiménez Román stated in The Afro-Latin Reader: History and Culture in the United States (2009) that ""[she] was able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries"".[323] In 2012, business magazine Forbes suggested that Lopez ""may be the most powerful entertainer on the planet"",[324] and named her ""the world's most powerful Latino celebrity"".[325]

Upon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Lopez contributed to the ""Latin explosion"" occurring in entertainment at the time.[326] Writing for The Recording Academy, Brian Haack described her as the ""breakout female star"" of the Latin pop movement in American music.[327] She was featured on the cover of the first issue of Latina magazine in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza stating that there is ""no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer"".[328] Around the time her career began to burgeon, the emphasis on Lopez's curvaceous figure grew; scholar Sean Redmond wrote that this was a sign of her role and social power in the cultural changes occurring in the United States.[329] In August 2005, Time listed Lopez as one of the most influential Hispanics in America, remarking: ""Why? Because over a decade ago, she was an anonymous background dancer on the second-rated sketch-comedy show. Today she's known by two syllables.""[49] In February 2007, People en Español named her the most influential Hispanic entertainer.[319] In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, Litarachna lopezae, after Lopez.[330][331]

Lopez is considered a global icon, and is often described as a triple threat performer.[332][333][334] VH1 ranked her at number 15 on their list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons,[335] number 16 on 100 Greatest Women In Music,[336] and number 21 on 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era.[337] Lopez has been cited as an influence or inspiration by a range of entertainers, including Jessica Alba,[338] Adrienne Bailon,[339] Kat DeLuna,[340] Mike Doughty,[341] Fifth Harmony,[342] Becky G,[343] Selena Gomez,[344] Ryan Guzman,[345] Kelly Key,[346] Q'orianka Kilcher,[347] Demi Lovato,[348] Normani,[349] Pitbull,[350] Francia Raisa,[339] Cierra Ramirez[351] Naya Rivera,[352] Bebe Rexha,[353] Rosa Salazar,[354] Gwen Stefani,[355] Stooshe,[356] and Kerry Washington.[357]

Famed for her distinct style and fashion sense, Us Weekly named Lopez ""Style Icon"" of the 2000s decade.[358] The Green Versace ""Jungle Dress"" that she wore at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000 was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by The Daily Telegraph.[359] The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google's image search.[360][361] Her style has influenced a range of celebrities, including Kelly Rowland, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Love Hewitt.[362][363][364] Her record-breaking fragrance line has become the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion as of 2012 .[365] Her first fragrance, Glow by JLo, has been credited with influencing the rise of celebrity fragrances in the 2000s,[366] with perfume critic Chandler Burr stating: ""Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive.""[367] Following the success of Lopez's appointment as a judge on American Idol in 2010, a trend of networks hiring ""big names"" for judging panels on reality shows ensued. The Hollywood Reporter branded this ""The J.Lo Effect"".[368]

Achievements

As of 2018 , Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, including 40 million albums,[369] and her films have grossed a cumulative total of US$3 billion.[370] She remains the only female entertainer to have a number one album and film simultaneously in the United States.[371][372] With her second studio album J.Lo (2001), Lopez became the first female solo recording artist under Epic Records to achieve a number one album in the United States since its inception in 1953.[373] Her album J to tha L-O! The Remixes was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the first number one remix album in the United States.[374] In 2010, Lopez was honored by the World Music Awards with the Legend Award for her contribution to the arts.[375] Lopez's return to prominence the following year with her single ""On the Floor""—among the best-selling singles of all time, and its music video recognized as the ""Highest Viewed Female Music Video of All Time"" by Guinness World Records in 2012—is regarded as one of the greatest musical comebacks in history.[376][377] In 2013, she was presented with the prestigious landmark 2,500th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her musical contributions,[378] and Univision presented her with the World Icon Award in its Premios Juventud.[379] In 2014, she became the first female recipient of the Billboard Icon Award.[380] Billboard magazine ranked her as the ninth greatest dance club artist of all time in 2016.[381] In 2017, she was awarded the Telemundo Star Award.[382] In 2018, Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first Latin performer to claim the prize since its introduction in 1984.[383]

230,"Princess Eugenie ""Frustrated"" Over ""Lack Of Attention"" Is Made-Up Story Is Princess Eugenie ""frustrated"" that she's not ""getting the attention she deserves"" for her royal work? That's the latest claim coming from a website known for its fabricated stories, but Gossip Cop can set the record straight. We're told it's ""rubbish.""

Can Nguyen/REX/Shutterstock

According to Celeb Dirty Laundry, not a single person ""seems to be paying any attention to Eugenie"" and the ""hard work she's been putting in to help raise money for charities."" On the other hand, purports the outlet, ""Kate Middleton [and] Meghan Markle are making headlines for their pregnancy and royal wedding plans."" Without a single source to support its premise, the often discredited site goes on to assert that the 27-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew recently raised ""more than $600,000 for elephant and rhino charities,"" but the gala ""didn't make any headlines"" as the ""media is focusing more on Prince Harry and Markle's upcoming royal wedding"" and Middleton's third pregnancy.

The outlet, which is routinely caught telling tales about the royal family, further alleges that this is ""frustrating for someone like Eugenie"" who has been ""trying so hard to be noticed in recent weeks."" The bad blog concludes, ""For the first time in a long time, she's taking her royal duties and responsibilities very seriously."" But Gossip Cop investigated the seemingly made-up report, and a royal source tells us the story is ""rubbish.""

Unlike CDL, Princess Eugenie understands that her cousins have a lot going on at the moment, particularly with engagements and pregnancies. Additionally, the princess has always lived relatively under-the-radar compared to Prince William and Prince Harry, and that isn't ""frustrating"" for her. The only remotely factual aspect of the entire story is that Princess Eugenie helped raise money for animal charities earlier this month, but she didn't take part in the gala just to receive media attention. It's all lies.

It should be noted, Gossip Cop previously corrected the untrustworthy website when it falsely alleged Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice were ""ignoring"" the announcement of Prince Harry and Markle's engagement. Much like that meritless and untrue claim, this latest one about Princess Eugenie feeling ""frustrated"" over a ""lack of attention"" in the media is equally phony.

232,"Teresa Giudice & Husband Joe Spend Their Birthdays Apart as Source Says He Lost 45 Lbs. in Prison Teresa and Joe Giudice can’t wait to “be a family again,” a source tells PEOPLE.

This week, the Real Housewives of New Jersey couple celebrated their 46th birthdays apart while Joe serves out his 41-month sentence for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud.

Joe, who transferred from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey, to a federal prison in Pennsylvania last November, has completed 27 months of his sentence thus far. Teresa served a little over 11 months in prison herself for the same crimes and was released on Dec. 23, 2015.

According to the source, the couple — who share daughters Gia, 17, Gabriella, 14, Milania, 12, and Audriana, 9 — “can’t wait to be reunited.”

“These last few years have been tough on everybody,” the insider adds.

Nevertheless, both have held onto a positive outlook. Joe has lost 45 lbs. in prison and Teresa — who trimmed down with yoga during her own sentence — is spending plenty of time with her daughters as she takes care of the household.

“Joe is working out,” the source says. “Teresa is, too. They both look better than ever.”

To celebrate Teresa’s May 18 birthday, the Giudice daughters threw her a surprise party at the house with close friends and family.

“She was very surprised and had no idea,” the source says. “Joe called during the party and wished her a happy birthday.”

For Joe’s May 22 birthday, he called the house and all the girls sang happy birthday to him.

In January, Teresa’s lawyer told PEOPLE that rumors of trouble in the couple’s marriage are completely false.

“It’s extremely sad that there are actually people out there and semi-reputable media outlets who seem to take pleasure in perpetuating horrible rumors and fake news stories about this family,” said attorney James J. Leonard Jr. “Haven’t they been through enough? Haven’t the children suffered enough? People need to let this family live their lives. Enough is enough. No one is cheating, no one is getting divorced. The truth is they can’t wait to be together again.”

“These last few years have been very challenging and very difficult,” he added. “Both Joe and Teresa have each lost a parent, have both experienced incarceration and have both been without one another for long periods of time. I can tell you from having deeply personal conversations with both of them, what they want more than anything is to be together with one another and their children and move forward to brighter days as a family.”",0
233,"Beyonce & Jay-Z’s Reported Baby Gift For Kim & Kanye West Costs $23k – Hollywood Life Did the power couples kiss and make up? — That’s the question after a new report claims Beyonce and JAY-Z gifted Kimye’s new baby girl with this $23k, custom-made piece of jewelry!

What does music’s most prominent power couple gift fashion’s most prominent power couple when a new baby arrives? Well, if you’re Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, it’s a custom-made, diamond Lorraine Schwartz bracelet, worth a whooping $21,000, according to The Sun. That’s right, Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West‘s third baby — who arrived on January 15 — is about to be the most decked out infant, well… ever. And, get this — Bey and JAY reportedly had the bracelet engraved with the number “3,” to signify Kimye’s third offspring.

“Beyonce and Jay could not be more pleased for them, they can’t wait to meet the little one, and have sent them this gift already,” a source told the outlet. “It shows they have all moved on from the past, and they are ‘familia’ once more.” Although all parties involved are reportedly thrilled about burying the hatchet, “Kanye is over the moon as he has always considered JAY Z his ‘big brother,’ and Beyonce has always been one of his closest friends.” Ironically, both power couples have three children each, and “it’s only a matter of time before the playdates begin,” the source added. Bey and JAY are parents to twins Sir and Rumi, who they welcomed in June 2016, and Blue Ivy, 6. Kim and Kanye are parents their daughter, North, 4, and son, Saint, 1, along with their new baby girl.

While this report indicates that JAY-Z and Kanye’s feud is over, JAY already hinted that he wanted to bury the hatchet during an interview with The New York Times back in November 2017. “But, that happens,” JAY admitted about there being tension with Ye’. JAY explained: “In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we’re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I’m saying? There’s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, ‘These are the things that I’m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.’ I’m sure he feels that I’ve done things to him as well. You know what I’m saying? These are — I’m not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.” JAY also said that he had recently spoken with Ye’ [at the time] and that they would always be good with each other. “I love Kanye. I do,” he said, adding, “It’s a complicated relationship with us.”

As you may know, JAY and Ye’s friendship took a hit back in 2016. In October of that year, Kanye went on a rant during one of his concerts where he slammed both JAY and Beyonce. He claimed their kids didn’t play together, and he revealed that there was tension between him and JAY because of a TIDAL music dispute. Ye’ even said that JAY and Beyonce didn’t even call after Kim’s 2016 Paris robbery. Just days after his rant, Kanye checked into UCLA Medical Center for an 8-9-day stay for an alleged mental breakdown.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Bey, JAY, Kim and Ye are all friends again?",0

He is looking for an intelligent, loyal companion. But he is always obsessed with design and wants to get a pet that is beautiful, stylish and moves great.

A rep for Pitt also laughed off the tail, er, tale.

Brad Pitt is getting a dog for companionship, according to a tabloid that is seemingly unaware he already has a dog. To exactly no one’s surprise, Gossip Cop can confirm this latest story about the actor was made-up.The piece in question can be found in the new edition of the National Enquirer, under the headline, “Brad Panting Over Dog!” The article begins by asserting the “lonely” Pitt is “on the hunt for a furry new friend!” A purported “top breeder” is quoted as saying, “Brad has been searching for a dog.“He seems to have narrowed his search down to a poodle or a Portuguese water dog,” continues the gossip magazine’s supposed tipster. While that may sound plausible, particularly since Pitt’s interest in design is well-known, the sourcing here is fishy. This alleged information comes from a purported “top breeder,” but the actor likely wouldn’t be working with a specific breeder yet if he doesn’t know which kind of dog he wants. Though standard poodles and Portuguese water dogs are considered somewhat similar canines, responsible breeders typically specialize in a single breed.What’s most strange is that nowhere does the outlet acknowledge that Pitt already has a pooch, and one that’s very different from poodles and Portuguese water dogs. The actor’s longtime pet is a bulldog, and the dog was actually mentioned multiple times in Pitt’s GQ cover story from earlier this year. In fact, Newsweek went as far as declaring Jacques was the “best thing” about the interview. Yet here’s the National Enquirer acting like he doesn’t even have a dog and suddenly needs to get one to stem his loneliness. Of course, it’s not out of the realm of possibility for Pitt to add another canine to his home, but that’s not even what the tabloid is claiming.Frankly, the supermarket tabloid has a lot of nerve claiming it knows anything about the star at all, after last year falsely accusing Pitt of beating Angelina Jolie and their kids. The magazine even doctored a photo to give Jolie a fake bruised appearance. It takes a lot of gall to write about Pitt, even on subjects as seemingly innocuous as getting a dog, after telling outright lies like that. And, for the record, Gossip Cop is told that no breeder legitimately connected to the actor leaked any real details about him getting a dog to this magazine.",0

Although Robert and Meghan did work together on the film “Remember Me,” he wasn’t on the guest list and a source close to Pattinson told Gossip Cop he laughed off the reports.

238,"The eight-hour diet Nicole Kidman swears by The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits.

The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode.

Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm.

Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works.

""The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,"" Lee said.

Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images

""As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.""

Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.

""By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,"" Lee said.

""New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.""

Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.

""But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,"" Lee said.

Acknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it.",0
239,"Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy 2004 controversy over indecent exposure on television

Super Bowl XXXVIII – which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004 from Houston, Texas on the CBS television network in the United States – was noted for a controversial halftime show in which Janet Jackson's breast, adorned with a nipple shield, was exposed by Justin Timberlake for about half a second, in what was later referred to as a ""wardrobe malfunction"".[1] The incident, sometimes referred to as Nipplegate,[2][3] was widely discussed. Along with the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting.[1] The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined CBS a record US$550,000 which was fought in the Supreme Court,[4] but that fine was appealed and ultimately voided by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2011 ruling, and a case to reinstate the fine was refused in 2012.[5][6]

The incident was ridiculed both within the United States and abroad, with a number of commentators considering the incident a planned publicity stunt,[7] and American commentators in particular viewing it as a sign of decreasing morality in American culture, while others considered the incident harmless and argued that it received an undue amount of attention and backlash.[8][9][10][11][12] The increased regulation of broadcasting raised concerns regarding censorship and free speech in the United States,[13] and the FCC increased the fine per indecency violation from US$27,500 to US$325,000 shortly after the event.[14] The halftime show that year was produced by MTV and was themed around the network's Choose or Lose campaign due to the event occurring during a presidential election year. Following the wardrobe incident, the National Football League (NFL) announced that MTV, which also produced the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXV, would not be involved in any halftime shows in the future.[15] The MTV Chief Executive stated in an interview with Reuters that Jackson engineered the stunt, while Timberlake was informed of it just moments before he took the stage.[16][17] The exposure was broadcast to a total audience of 143.6 million viewers.[18]

YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim claims that this incident was what led to the creation of the video sharing website.[19][20] The incident also made ""Janet Jackson"" the most searched term, event, and image in Internet history, as well as the most searched person and term of 2004 and 2005.[21][22][23][24] The incident also broke the record for ""most searched event over one day"".[25] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as ""Most Searched in Internet History"" and the ""Most Searched for News Item"".[26] It became the most watched, recorded and replayed television moment in TiVo history and ""enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up"".[27][28][29] The incident also coined the phrase ""wardrobe malfunction"", which was later added to the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.[30]

Following the incident, CBS parent company Viacom, and their co-owned subsidiaries MTV and Infinity Broadcasting, enforced a blacklist of Jackson's singles and music videos on many radio formats and music channels worldwide.[31] As of 2018, neither Jackson nor Timberlake are banned from the halftime show.[32] Timberlake later performed at Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018.

Background and development [ edit ]

In 2002, Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI, however the NFL ultimately decided to select U2 to headline it after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks.[33] In September 2003, the NFL announced that Jackson would be the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[34] Because the event was occurring during an election year, MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's ""Choose or Lose"" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote.[35]

Prior to the incident, Timberlake had attended Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour as an adolescent, and Jackson's energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him.[36] While Timberlake was a member of pop group 'N Sync, Jackson selected the boy band as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster Velvet Rope World Tour, which helped promote and introduce the then-relatively unknown group and Timberlake to the public worldwide.[37] Timberlake said he was ""psyched"" and later described the experience as ""fulfilling"".[38][39] While on the tour, Jackson further promoted the group by performing with 'N Sync on several dates, including joining the group for a live a cappella duet of Stevie Wonder's ""Overjoyed"", which a biography stated was a ""highlight"" moment for Timberlake which ""gave Justin a chance to show his family and friends how far he had come"".[40] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became ""good friends"", with Jackson also praising Timberlake.[41] Timberlake recreated Jackson's ""That's the Way Love Goes"" video with 'N Sync and was inspired by Jackson's performing style.[42]

Timberlake had frequently mentioned admiring Jackson in many interviews during this time and throughout the following few years preceding the incident.[38][39][43] When asked who he thought was ""the sexiest woman on the planet"", Timberlake had said ""I've thought Janet Jackson has nothing but sex appeal, so I'd probably say her.""[44]

Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on ""(And She Said) Take Me Now"", a song from his debut solo album Justified which was initially planned to be released as a single, commenting ""I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just thought we should get a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers. I mean, she sounds like an angel.""[45]

Incident [ edit ]

During the halftime show, Jackson performed a medley of hits, beginning with ""All for You"", ""Rhythm Nation"" and a brief excerpt of ""The Knowledge"" before surprise guest Timberlake appeared to perform a duet of his song ""Rock Your Body"" with Jackson.[46][47] The performance featured several suggestive dance moves by both singers, and as Timberlake reached his final line of ""Rock Your Body"", ""I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song"", Timberlake pulled off a part of Jackson's costume, revealing her right breast, partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry, for less than a second (after which the CBS broadcast immediately cut to an aerial view of Reliant Stadium). MTV's CEO Tom Freston claimed in an interview with the Reuters news agency that the exposure was a stunt orchestrated by Jackson.[48] Jackson's publicist stated the performance ending was only supposed to reveal Jackson's red lace bra, though the lace undergarment was accidentally removed along with the outer layer.[8][49]

Responses [ edit ]

""It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ..."" ""But there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand"". – Jackson on Super Bowl incident.[50]

MTV stated, ""The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance. MTV regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it.""[51] The network also said, ""Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident"".[52] A statement from CBS read, ""We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended.""[51] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands ""what a difference one percent can make"". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the ""tasteful, first-class entertainment"" the league expected. FCC Chairman Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident ""a new low for prime time television"".[53][54] Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, ""We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.""[51] An hour-long MTV documentary titled ""Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show"" was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.[55][56]

Salli Frattini, the executive producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled a phone call from the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. ""We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'"", Frattini said. ""There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s[hit]. What just happened?'"" Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. ""I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay"", he said. ""Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport."" Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible ""set up"", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats.[57] An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, ""When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song"".[8] The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.[8]

Jackson's representative explained the incident, saying, ""Justin was supposed to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed.""[58] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said ""My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [and] the NFL had no knowledge of this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention"". A written statement read, ""The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL.""[52] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, ""It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand.""[50] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, ""Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason.""[50]

Publicist Marvet Britto stated, ""Jackson embodies grace, style and integrity...She has never been known as a bad person."" Britto describes Jackson’s videotaped apology as ""impersonal"", saying, ""She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived."" Jackson said of the apology, ""I probably should have done it live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it.""[59] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition.[60] Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting ""I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius.""[61] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career[36][38]) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. ""I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way"", said Jackson. ""I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that.""[62] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, ""I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it.""[63]

famine, homelessness, ""[The furor] is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war AIDS . [...] They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. [...] People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast."" – Jackson questioning media's focus on the event.[50]

Michael Musto of The Village Voice commented on the media's reaction to the incident, saying, ""Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast was used as a diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone.""[64] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor ""is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS"". The fact that it happened in an election year ""did have a great deal to do with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people.""[31]Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as ""contradictory"", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both ""very sexual"" and ""practically omnipresent"".[64] Jackson also said the mishap was ""not intentional"" and a ""costume accident"", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, ""Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way.""[65] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, ""It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense."" In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. ""People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can.""[66]

Immediately following the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, ""Hey man, we love giving you all something to talk about.""[49] Timberlake released a statement saying ""I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable.""[51] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying ""I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended.""[67] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, ""All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'"" Timberlake said. ""I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And the fact of the matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music.""[68] Timberlake later declared, ""It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys.""[69] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse.[70] While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, ""In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'"" He added, ""I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.""[71]

Media diversion [ edit ]

Jackson suspected ulterior motives in the media's reaction, expressing, ""It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, and it happened to me.""[50] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, ""Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling to do anything about the violence on television, where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids."" Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, ""Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere"", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a ""sound bite attempt"" by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. ""When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention"", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be ""inappropriate"" that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. ""What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl"", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit.[72] The Boston Legal episode ""Let Sales Ring"" likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media.[73] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, ""For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade.""[74] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, ""It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant ""news"", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else.""[75]

Powell's response [ edit ]

A decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, ""I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?"" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing ""an outrageous stunt"", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. ""I personally thought that was really unfair"", he said. ""It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate.""[57]

Public reaction [ edit ]

United States [ edit ]

In the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines, in which it was sometimes referred to as ""Nipplegate"".[2][3] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement that same day condemning the halftime show, announcing that their members would file indecency complaints with the FCC and the council supported the Commission's decision to investigate the halftime show immediately.[76] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans,[15] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them.[77] In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.[78] Columnists L. Brent Bozell III[9] (who also founded the Parents Television Council) and Phyllis Schlafly[12] also expressed criticism of the halftime show in their weekly columns. Democratic senator Zell Miller of Georgia, both on the floor of the United States Senate[11] and in an editorial on Salon.com,[10] denounced the halftime show as what he perceived as declining morality in America. The day immediately following the Super Bowl, then-FCC chairman Michael Powell ordered an investigation into the halftime show..[1] Timberlake told CBS owned-and-operated station KCBS-TV in Los Angeles a few days following the Super Bowl that even his own family was offended by the mishap at the end of the halftime show.[79] However, an Associated Press poll taken nearly three weeks after the Super Bowl found that although 54% of American adults considered the exposure distasteful, only 18% supported the FCC's investigation.[80] Film director Spike Lee, speaking at Kent State University at Stark on February 3, called the incident a ""new low"" in entertainment.[2]

The Super Bowl controversy was also a subject of humor on all of the late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he ""was happy to see this thing happen ... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS"".[81] The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a ""Department of Wardrobe Security"" to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions.[82] On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction.[83] Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night[84] briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener.[85] Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting ""I wore them once, they were cute.""[86] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation ""silly"", commenting ""In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this."" Dean added ""I don't find it terribly shocking relative to some of the things you can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC probably has a lot of other things they should be pursuing.""[87]

South Park (aired on Comedy Central, a sister network to CBS at the time, and to MTV through Viacom) took aim at the hysteria in its eighth season premiere, ""Good Times with Weapons"", on March 17 of that year when Eric Cartman sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a ""wardrobe malfunction"". The townspeople are angered by Cartman's display, rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character (Butters) who is also present on stage – a reference to the American culture's acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity.[88] During the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, comedian Dave Chappelle joked that his appearance on the VMAs was ""the biggest mistake [MTV made] since [they] put Janet Jackson on the Super Bowl.""[89] Family Guy also did an episode based around the ""wardrobe malfunction"" and the FCC's crackdown on ""indecent"" content, with one scene parodying the incident directly.[90] The fourth season episode ""PTV"" involved actor David Hyde Pierce having a trouser malfunction at the Emmys. The FCC's sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered Peter Griffin to start his own network with looser content standards, PTV, on which later in the same episode, he presents a show called the ""Side Boob Hour"" which among other risque programs he puts on leads his objected wife Lois to call the FCC to crack down on PTV (leading to the implication of the FCC also regulating what his family says and does).

The halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005. At the beginning of 2005, the parody newspaper The Onion ran as its headline article for January 26, 2005, ""U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV"". The article's satirical target was the nation's reaction to the incident, rather than the incident itself.[91] On February 1, 2005, exactly one year after the halftime show, the PTC released a report titled MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol, covering MTV programming during the network's ""Spring Break"" week from March 20 to 27, 2004, accusing MTV of irresponsibly promoting sex, drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth. In response to the report, MTV network executive Jeannie Kedas argued that the report ""underestimates young people's intellect and their level of sophistication.""[92] On February 6, however, New York Times columnist Frank Rich argued that censorship on television was becoming more prevalent following the halftime show in his February 6, 2005 column ""The Year of Living Indecently"". Examples he cited included PBS editing obscene language out of certain programs such as the British terrorist drama Dirty War and more than 60 ABC-affiliated stations (including those owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, E. W. Scripps Company, Hearst-Argyle Television and Cox Broadcasting) refusing to broadcast Saving Private Ryan due to the profanity prevalent throughout the film, which was to be aired unedited in its entirety by the network. (The latter, which would later be ruled the FCC to not violate regulations, would air on cable afterwards to avoid controversy.)[93] The ESPN series Playmakers was also immediately forced to be canceled by the NFL following the incident.[94][95] A commercial from Budweiser, which depicted a man opening a beverage on the outfit's breastplate and tearing it before it was worn, was intended to be aired during Super Bowl XXXIX the following year, but was pulled before its broadcast.[96][97]

Canada [ edit ]

In Canada, where the Super Bowl telecast was broadcast by the Global Television Network, the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians complained about the incident to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC).[98] The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues (though some were expected complaints about Canadian content/simsub issues preventing viewing of the popular American advertisements, which is a common issue among Canadian viewers of the Super Bowl to the present day).[99] Professor Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, stated: ""I know many people in other countries are scratching their heads and thinking 'What in the world is the big fuss over there?'""[100]

New Zealand [ edit ]

New Zealand news outlets re-broadcast the ""nipplegate"" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary explaining that American ultra-conservatives had made the incident into a major controversy. The nation's largest newspaper, the New Zealand Herald, ran an op-ed from a New Zealander living in the US detailing his bafflement at his American friends, who had expressed outrage at the glimpse of nipple while supporting their country's invasion of Iraq and being fans of the television show Sex and the City.[101]

Legal action [ edit ]

On February 4, Terri Carlin, a banker residing in Knoxville, Tennessee, filed a class action lawsuit against Jackson and Timberlake on behalf of ""all American citizens who watched the outrageous conduct"". The lawsuit alleged that the halftime show contained ""sexually explicit acts solely designed to garner publicity and, ultimately, to increase profits for themselves"". The lawsuit sought maximum punitive and compensatory damages from the performers. Carlin later dropped the lawsuit.[102] Three months later, Eric Stephenson, a lawyer from Farmington, Utah, filed a US$5,000 lawsuit in small-claims court against Viacom for false advertising of the Super Bowl halftime show, as he, the father of three young children, claimed that pre-game advertising led him to believe that the halftime show would consist of marching bands, balloons and a patriotic celebration.[103] The lawsuit was rejected because Stephenson should have filed a federal lawsuit or complaint to the FCC, which was already investigating the halftime show.[104]

America Online, the Internet service provider that sponsored the halftime show, demanded a refund of the approximately US$7.5 million that it paid to sponsor and advertise on the halftime show. However, no other advertisers of the Super Bowl had similar demands.[105]

The halftime show led to a great spike in FCC-issued fines and received complaints compared to those from previous years.

The incident triggered a rash of fines that the FCC levied soon after the Super Bowl, alleging that the context of the ""wardrobe malfunction"" was intended ""to pander, titillate and shock those watching"" because it happened within the lyrics within Timberlake's performance of Rock Your Body: ""Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long ... better have you naked by the end of this song.""[106] In addition, the FCC cited a news article on MTV's website (MTV.com) claiming that the halftime show would promise ""shocking moments""[107] and that ""officials of both CBS and MTV were well aware of the overall sexual nature of the Jackson/Timberlake segment, and fully sanctioned it – indeed, touted it as 'shocking' to attract potential viewers"".[106] CBS, however, argued that the exposure was unplanned,[108] although in later statements CBS asserted that while the exposure was unplanned by CBS, it was deliberately planned by Timberlake and Jackson ""independently and clandestinely"".[109] On September 22, 2004, the FCC fined Viacom the maximum penalty of US$27,500 for each of the 20 CBS-owned television stations (including satellites of WFRV in Green Bay, WCCO in Minneapolis and KUTV in Salt Lake City; current CBS owned-and-operated station KOVR in Sacramento at the time was owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group) for a fine totaling US$550,000, the largest ever placed against a television broadcaster at that time.[4][110] However, the Parents Television Council[111] and even some of the FCC commissioners[106] criticized the Commission for fining only 20 CBS stations, not all of them, for the halftime show. 66% of respondents to a March 2005 Time magazine poll believed that the FCC overreacted to the halftime show by fining CBS.[112]

On November 24, 2004, Viacom paid out US$3.5 million to settle outstanding indecency complaints and stated that it would challenge the US$550,000 penalty related to the incident, on the grounds that the broadcast was unintentional and thus exempt from indecency regulation.[113] In March 2006, the FCC affirmed that the Super Bowl halftime show was indecent,[114] so CBS paid the FCC's issued fine in July 2006 in order to take their appeal against their fine to federal court.[115] CBS appealed the fine on September 17 at the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.[116]

On July 21, 2008, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled[117] in favor of CBS, voiding the FCC's fine on the grounds that the enforcement involved a significant deviation from prior practice that was not announced as a clear policy change.[118][119][120] On May 4, 2009, however, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case back to the Third Circuit for reconsideration in light of the previously decided Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations (2009).[121][122]

On November 2, 2011, the Third Circuit Court ruled 2–1 that its earlier decision was correct, citing that the broadcast was legal under the FCC's then-current policy of allowing ""fleeting"" indecency on the airwaves, and that it was unfair of the FCC to change the policy retroactively.[5][123] On June 29, 2012, the Supreme Court declined an FCC appeal.[6][124]

Other controversies [ edit ]

Commercials [ edit ]

Prior to the broadcast, CBS rejected the MoveOn.org Super Bowl ad Bush in 30 Seconds because it was deemed too controversial. CBS stated that it had a ""decades-old"" policy of rejecting advertisements regarding ""controversial issues of public importance"", although MoveOn charged that the networks had previously accepted similar advertisements from other groups.[125] The Super Bowl broadcast featured numerous commercials for erectile dysfunction medicines and advertisements for Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light brand featuring a flatulating horse and a dog attacking male genitalia; however, no politically charged advertisements appeared during the telecast.[126] CBS, which also held the rights to Super Bowl XLIV, later aired a commercial during that game featuring then-Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother that discreetly refer to their pro-life viewpoints. The ad, sponsored by Focus on the Family, received similar controversy.[127][128] In a league-mandated policy meant to clear the airwaves of such advertisements, the NFL announced that those types of commercials would not air again during Super Bowl broadcasts (the league ended an advertising relationship with Levitra in March 2007 as an official league sponsor).[129]

In January 2005, Fox, the network that carried Super Bowl XXXIX under the NFL's alternating network contract for the championship game, rejected an advertisement for the cold remedy Airborne that briefly featured the naked buttocks of veteran actor Mickey Rooney.[93]

Streaking [ edit ]

Moments after the Jackson-Timberlake tangle, streaker Mark Roberts added to the controversial halftime by running around the field naked except for some writing on his body which read ""SUPER BOWEL"" on the front, an advertisement for an online betting website, and a well-placed G-string attached to half of a miniature football covering Roberts' genitals.[130] Part of Roberts' stunt was broadcast in the United States; CBS chose to keep its cameras in a wide-shot view of the stadium and use quick cutaways to players and coaches as Roberts ran around the field until players from both competing teams, the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers, tackled him. Matt Chatham, the Patriots' special teams expert and reserve linebacker initially knocked Roberts down, thus allowing stadium security and police to arrest Roberts and take him into custody.[131]

Other performers [ edit ]

Aside from Jackson's exposure, minor controversy around the show's other performances included rappers P. Diddy and Nelly gesturing towards their crotches[citation needed], stripping cheerleaders[citation needed], and musician Kid Rock appearing in a poncho made from a slit American flag, which he later threw towards the audience.[2][132] U.S. Senator Zell Miller complained that Kid Rock's outfit was a desecration of the American flag.[133]

Aftermath and effects [ edit ]

Censorship and regulation of broadcasting [ edit ]

Website Soap Opera Central speculated that the fallout from this incident may have had a subtle effect on daytime television. These television shows are known for ""love in the afternoon"" and regularly feature romantic couplings; shortly before the Super Bowl, the Procter & Gamble soap operas As the World Turns and Guiding Light had gone as far as featuring rear male nudity during sexual scenes. After the Super Bowl controversy, FCC commissioner Michael J. Copps stated that it was time for a crackdown on inappropriate sexual content in daytime television, and indicated that he was reviewing whether soap operas were violating the agency's indecency prohibitions.[134]

Two other major sporting events that followed the Super Bowl that year also were forced to censor their respective halftime shows following the incident. The Pro Bowl, which would be played on February 8 at Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, originally was to feature singer JC Chasez, who was a member of boy band 'N Sync as was Timberlake, sing the National Anthem before the game and perform his hit song ""Blowin' Me Up (with Her Love)"" at halftime. However, the NFL did not allow Chasez to perform during halftime due to the sexually suggestive content of his chosen song (even though the game was carried by ESPN, which is not under the content purview of the FCC as it is a cable network, and therefore only self-regulates content as an advertiser-supported service), replacing it with traditional Hawaiʻian dancers.[135][136] The 2004 NBA All-Star Game also censored its act, despite being broadcast on TNT (which in reiteration, is not bound by FCC content regulations as a cable network), having halftime performer Beyoncé Knowles perform ""Crazy in Love"" rather than ""Naughty Girl"", which they feared would incite controversy given its sexual content. Jackson was in attendance at the game, and dressed conservatively.[137] The networks that were to broadcast the 46th Grammy Awards (CBS) and the 76th Academy Awards (ABC), live events scheduled for February 8 and February 29 respectively, enhanced their broadcast delays to accommodate editing of inappropriate video in addition to audio.[138][139]

Following these announcements, Guiding Light edited out nudity from an episode that had already been taped. A week later, the show's executive producer John Conboy was fired and replaced by Ellen Wheeler. All nine American network soaps began to impose an unwritten rule of avoiding any sort of risqué adult scenes, and in the months following, editors of soap opera periodical Soap Opera Digest wrote about how daytime television was losing its steam.[134] NBC also re-edited a scene from an episode of its medical drama ER where paramedics were wheeling an elderly woman into the hospital, and her breast could be seen non-explicitly in the context of her injury and treatment.[140] Even as late as Veterans Day (November 11) of 2004, 65 ABC-affiliated stations pre-empted the uncut network presentation of the film Saving Private Ryan over concerns about the film's violent and profane content and FCC regulations. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly quoted L. Brent Bozell III and Peggy Noonan associating the mass pre-emption of Ryan with the halftime show incident.[141] The annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was cancelled for that year in reaction to the incident.[142]

A petition was filed by a consortium of broadcasters (which included Viacom) and the RIAA over an FCC indecency ruling, regarding fleeting expletives uttered by Bono of U2 when accepting an award at the 60th Golden Globe Awards in 2003. It argued that the FCC had implemented a standard ""that would allow it to censor all kinds of things — anything considered blasphemous, coarse or vulgar"", and observed that many radio stations, especially rock-formatted stations, had been engaging in self-censorship by censoring or removing songs from their libraries, so that they would not run afoul of the stricter regulation.[143] Clear Channel Communications removed talk-radio host Howard Stern from several of its large-market radio stations within a month of the incident, citing the raunchy content of Stern's show. The FCC fined Clear Channel over allegedly indecent content on the Bubba the Love Sponge radio show.[144] As a result of the incident, some networks established regulations requiring time delays of as much as five minutes for live broadcasts such as awards shows and sporting events.[145] In late 2004, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the maximum FCC fine penalty from said US$27,500 to US$500,000 per violation; the United States Senate voted to decrease it to US$275,000 per incident, with a cap of US$3 million per day.[4] By June 2006, the two houses reconciled the differences in fine levels, settling for a fine of US$325,000 per violation in the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005.[14]

The incident also prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers. Viacom, at the center of the controversy, also employed the controversial Howard Stern in its radio division (at the time called Infinity Broadcasting). The expanding control on content is said to be a contributing factor that drove Stern away from terrestrial radio and onto Sirius Satellite Radio, and is sometimes credited as the media figure most responsible for introducing a new era in radio.[8] It has also been reported that some teen-oriented awards shows in the summer of 2004 had also been purged of most sexual and profane content that had been perceived as staples in such awards telecasts in the past, including Fox's Teen Choice Awards and MTV's self-created Video Music Awards.[89] Author Frederick S. Lane stated in an interview with John Eggerton of Broadcasting & Cable magazine that the controversy surrounding the halftime show was the primary inspiration for his 2006 book The Decency Wars: The Campaign to Cleanse American Culture, which explains moral controversies in the American media over the years.[146]

The Super Bowl itself would not feature a modern act for its halftime show for the next six years, opting instead for classic rockers such as Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Prince, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, and The Who (McCartney, the Stones and The Who were all part of the British Invasion of the 1960s). In fact, no women performed at the Super Bowl halftime show at all until The Black Eyed Peas performed in 2011.

In 2012, during the halftime show for Super Bowl XLVI, rapper M.I.A. pointed up her middle finger during her performance. That incident drew comparisons with the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast in the Super Bowl halftime show eight years prior. The Associated Press asserted that people learned what M.I.A. did only when reports surfaced in the media and quoted TV critic James Poniewozik: ""I had no idea she even did it until NBC issued an apology for it.""[147] NBC blurred the entire screen albeit a second too late to obscure M.I.A. giving the finger.[148] The NFL ultimately sued M.I.A. for US$1.5 million on breach of contract grounds.[8] The lawsuit was settled in August 2014 and the terms of the settlement remained private.[149] As an indication of the reduced level of complaints, only 222 complaints were filed over the incident.[150]

Sports broadcasting [ edit ]

Sports would be greatly affected by the controversy. Three weeks later, NASCAR announced at the driver and crew chief meeting at North Carolina Speedway that it would stiffen penalties on use of improper language or gestures including larger fines, loss of points (if it occurred in a post-race interview or after the driver fell out of a race), ejection of a team from the race, or lap penalties (if in-race) under the circuit's ""detrimental to NASCAR"" rule.[151] Johnny Sauter was fined US$10,000 and 25 points a week after the new rule took in effect for obscene language in an interview.[152] Later in 2004, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. received a 25-point penalty and a US$50,000 fine when he used an obscenity after winning the 2004 EA Sports 500 at Talladega Superspeedway.[153] He lost the championship lead after that incident and lost the championship by 100 points after the incident. In 2007, Tony Stewart received a similar penalty after using an obscenity in a post-race interview following his Brickyard 400 win. Kyle Busch, in November 2010, was fined US$25,000 for an obscene gesture caught on ESPN, along with an in-race two-lap penalty, as the gesture was aimed at a NASCAR official.[154]

The NFL also came under some smaller controversies over its telecasts. The FCC received a complaint about Fox's telecast of a January 2005 playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings; the complainant alleged that Minnesota player Randy Moss, who scored a touchdown, apparently made movements appearing to moon the spectators. However, the FCC denied the complaint because Moss was fully clothed at all times, and his gestures were shown for only a few seconds, thus warranting that the display was not indecent; game announcer Joe Buck also immediately condemned the act (and additionally, Moss was fined by the NFL).[155] On January 13, 2007, during Fox's coverage of an NFL playoff game between the New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles, the camera cut to the stands, showing for four seconds a shirt with the words ""Fuck DA EAGLES"" that was worn by a female spectator. That drew a backlash from the Parents Television Council, which filed complaints with the FCC.[156]

During NBC's live broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, the five-year anniversary of the original incident, affiliate KVOA-TV's analog broadcast feed (the high definition feed of the station was unaffected) over Comcast's Tucson, Arizona system was interrupted by an unknown party, when an excerpt of a film aired by adult cable channel Shorteez was broadcast for 30 seconds to local Comcast subscribers just after Larry Fitzgerald scored his fourth-quarter touchdown to take the Cardinals to a 23–20 lead. Afterwards, 10 seconds of an end credit segment from ClubJenna (which, like Shorteez, is owned by Playboy Enterprises) was shown.[157] Comcast offered a US$10 credit for customers who claimed to have seen the incident,[158] and the Federal Communications Commission announced that it would investigate the cause of the incident. E! Online columnist Josh Grossberg stated: ""This almost makes us nostalgic for the days of Nipplegate.""[159]

2004 presidential election [ edit ]

Frederick S. Lane argued in his 2006 book The Decency Wars that the Super Bowl halftime show controversy influenced the primary focus on ""moral values"" and ""media decency"" in the 2004 Democratic Party primaries.[160] Jackson claimed the incident was used in the media as a diversion for President George W. Bush's poor approval ratings and the Iraq War, with Bush and First Lady Laura Bush giving public commentary on the incident rather than focusing on other issues.[31]

Impact on Jackson [ edit ]

""[We are] absolutely bailing on the record [...] The pressure is so great, they can't align with anything related to Janet. The high-ups are still pissed at her, and this is a punitive measure."" ""[...] radio wouldn't play it and MTV wouldn't play her videos for ""I Want You"" and ""All Nite"", two songs that would've been out-of-the-park hits at any other point in Jackson's career."" – Viacom revealing Jackson's blacklist; commentary from The Charlotte Observer[31]

Viacom CEO Les Moonves ordered that Janet Jackson's singles and music videos be blacklisted from all of its properties, including CBS, MTV, and its radio station group Infinity Broadcasting.[161] Jackson was intended to appear at the 46th Grammy Awards, which was being held the following week and televised by CBS, but her invitation was withdrawn due to the incident. Jackson was originally scheduled to appear as a presenter for a tribute to Luther Vandross, performed by Celine Dion, Richard Marx and Alicia Keys, and was chosen due to previously collaborating with Vandross on the number-one hit ""The Best Things in Life Are Free"". According to People Magazine, Jackson ""had been slated to speak before the accolade but was being pressured to bow out gracefully – or face being uninvited"", before later being completely barred from attending. However, Timberlake was still allowed to attend and perform at the event.[162][163] The majority of the artists at the ceremony were also asked to comment on Jackson's incident.[164]

Jackson had also been cast to play Lena Horne in a movie about the singer and activist's life, which was to be produced by ABC, but was forced to resign following the performance incident.[58] A statue of Mickey Mouse wearing Jackson's iconic ""Rhythm Nation"" outfit was mantled at Walt Disney World theme park the previous year to honor Jackson's legacy, but was removed following Jackson's controversial performance. A spokesman for Disney said, ""Considering all the controversy [the performance] drew, we talked it over for a couple of days and decided it would be best to replace hers with a new one.""[165]

The blacklisting affected promotion of Janet Jackson's first album released since the incident Damita Jo—her eighth studio album. A majority of the reviews for the album, including those by AllMusic, the BBC, Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian and The New York Times focused on the negative backlash suffered by Jackson as a result of the incident but gave favorable reviews to the album itself.[166][167][168] Blender Magazine considered the album's success to be ""a minor-chord ""F-you"" victory to the wolves nipping at Janet's tits.""[31] Despite the blacklisting, Damita Jo was a success and certified Platinum, selling over three million copies worldwide and also receiving a Grammy nomination. Singles from the album like ""Just a Little While"" and ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"" reached #1 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Although receiving positive reception, the incident also affected the performance of following albums 20 Y.O. and Discipline due to the blacklist. However, 20 Y.O. managed to sell over 1.5 million copies worldwide, was certified Platinum in the US and received a Grammy nomination.[46][169] Additionally, ""Feedback"" reached the top 20 pop hit on the Billboard Hot 100, selling one million copies worldwide. Subsequent releases ""Make Me"" peaked atop the Hot Dance Club Songs and top 20 internationally; ""Nothing"" reached #1 on the digital pop and music video charts, also considered for an Oscar nomination.[170][31][74][170][171]

In her first interview since the incident, Jackson appeared on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on March 29, 2004, which increased the show's ratings over 20%.[172] In April 2004, Jackson poked fun at herself in an appearance on Saturday Night Live, first while playing Condoleezza Rice in a skit, nervously answering a question by exposing her right breast (which was pixelated by NBC), and again by viewing a mock home video from her childhood in which her bathing suit top came off in a wading pool, calling it a ""swimsuit malfunction"".[170][173] An NBC spokesman said Jackson was wearing a bra beneath her blouse during the skit.[174] During a performance on ABC's Good Morning America, the network promoted Jackson's appearance as her ""first live performance since the Super Bowl"", hinting at the chance of shock value. Blender Magazine recalled ""Photographers and camera crews are packed in, in case Jackson decides to show us the left one. And if all eyes (and cameras) are on her chest, Jackson, 38, responds defiantly by refusing to cloak her breasts in a modest turtleneck. The cleavage is her way of saying 'fuck you.'""[31] In 2006, during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jackson upheld her claim that the Super Bowl scandal was an accident.[175]

Impact on Timberlake [ edit ]

Immediately following the incident Timberlake jokingly dismissed it, telling the inquisitive press: ""[Jackson and I] love giving you all something to talk about.""[49] His attitude quickly changed as the scandal grew into a serious controversy. People Magazine stated Timberlake was referred to as ""the Teflon man"" at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards because the incident did not affect him as it did with Jackson.[58] In a 2006 interview with MTV, Timberlake said that compared to the huge backlash Jackson suffered, he himself received only about 10% of the blame; and he accused American society of being both ""harsher on women"" and ""unfairly harsh on ethnic people"".[71] Prior to plans for the Super Bowl performance, Jackson and Timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for Jackson's Damita Jo album, as well as a rumored collaboration for a Quincy Jones album, though neither came to fruition.[176][177] In November 2013, Timberlake performed a cover of Jackson's ""Let's Wait Awhile"" on The 20/20 Experience World Tour before transitioning into his song ""Until the End of Time"", which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to Jackson.[178]

Media commentators stated Jackson was treated too harshly by the media and public, while Timberlake's career was not affected much by the incident. Shannon L. Holland in Women's Studies in Communication argued that the media reaction after the incident focused disproportionately on Jackson, ""represent[ing] her as a contemporary Jezebel in that her racial and gendered Otherness was often juxtaposed with the 'normalcy' of Timberlake's white masculinity. That is, she emerged in a public discourse as the primary (if not sole) instigator of the lewd act, a scheming seductress who manipulated Timberlake for her own economic gain.""[179] In 2014, former FCC chairman Michael Powell, who had enforced fines on the conglomerates involved with the broadcast following the incident, stated: ""I personally thought that was really unfair. It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplate.""[57] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone stated ""Justin isn't exactly Mr. Loyalty -- he totally left Janet Jackson to take the heat after the Super Bowl.'""[180] E! Online also commented ""Timberlake wasted no time placing the bulk of the blame for the incident on Jackson. And, of course, the woman takes the blame even though the man stripped her. Pathetically typical.""[68][181] A reporter for VH1 said ""JT still gets a side eye for leaving her out to dry.""[182]

One observer claimed ""Despite her 'wardrobe malfunction' – for which we think Justin Timberlake wasn't punished nearly as severely for – Janet put on a pretty amazing show.""[183] The New York Times noted ""[a]fter her right breast upstaged the Super Bowl, she was criticized by the first lady, vilified by media executives and abandoned by her co-conspirator, Justin Timberlake; less excitable commentators suggested she was merely a shrewd publicity-stunt woman with a new album to promote.""[168] Jackson's parents, Joe and Katherine Jackson, also expressed concern that Timberlake did not stand by Janet following the incident, commenting, ""What I didn't like is there wasn't one person on that stage, there were two people. After a while, there was only Janet Jackson. That's all there was. Janet Jackson,"" adding ""Janet don't pull that thing open herself. He did it. We were surprised that they didn't say anything to Justin about it.""[184]

Timberlake would eventually be invited back to the Super Bowl halftime show when he was named headlining act for the Super Bowl LII halftime show in February 2018.[185] During his performance, Timberlake again sang a portion of ""Rock Your Body,"" but stopped right before reaching the ""I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song"" lyric, saying ""hold up! Stop!"" and smiling.[186] Some commentators interpreted this as a subtle reference to the 2004 incident.[187][188]

Popular culture [ edit ]

Pop singer Katy Perry parodied Jackson's Super Bowl incident in the music video for her single ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" during a scene where Perry's breast is accidentally exposed at a school event.[189][190] Jackson's incident is also recreated in Eminem's ""Ass Like That"" music video. The controversy and sexual nature surrounding Miley Cyrus' performance of ""We Can't Stop"" and ""Blurred Lines""/""Give It 2 U"" with guest artist Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards was likened to Jackson's performance with Timberlake at the Super Bowl event.[191]

The term ""wardrobe malfunction"", which was developed to describe Jackson's incident in a public statement and was later added to the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, has influenced media by frequently being used by various entertainers and publications when describing revealing outfits or, more so, accidental public exposures or nudity. The term's frequent usage following the incident has led to numerous entertainment outlets compiling various celebrity ""wardrobe malfunctions"", with Jackson included in the lists as the most infamous example and originator of the term.[192][193]

Several songs have mentioned Jackson's performance, most notably Drake in Birdman's ""Money to Blow"" and Eminem's ""Ass Like That"", as well as Drake's ""Zone"", Tyga's ""Tyga Montana"", 50 Cent's ""Just a Touch"", Kanye West in Mase's ""Be Alright (Welcome Back Remix)"", Tech N9ne's ""Pornographic"" and ""Flash"", T-Pain's ""Therapy"", Chamillionaire's ""Talking That Talk"", and Common in Jadakiss's ""Why? (Remix) and in Lil Wayne's ""Grindin"""".

Justin Timberlake referenced the incident when ripping off part of Kristen Wiig's outfit during an appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2009.[194] The Family Guy episode ""PTV"" was written as a parody of the FCC's strict measures and regulations following Jackson's Super Bowl halftime show performance controversy.[195] A scene from the episode involving the fictional portrayal of an extreme reaction to actor David Hyde Pierce having a wardrobe malfunction at the Emmy Awards was also a recreation and reference to the incident.[196] Jackson's performance is again referenced in a brief scene where Peter Griffin is dressed in Jackson's Super Bowl outfit and has his breast exposed by Justin Timberlake during the musical number ""The Freaking FCC"".[197] The song itself was introduced when Lois called the FCC in response to a PTV show called ""The Side Boob Hour."" The episode received Primetime Emmy Award and Annie Award nominations for its subject matter. Jackson's performance also inspired the South Park episode ""Good Times with Weapons"". In the episode, the show's creators draw attention to the media and public's unnecessary reaction to Jackson's brief exposure while disregarding or accepting extreme acts of violence during a scene where the public is outraged when Eric Cartman is seen naked and having a ""wardrobe malfunction"" on stage, while character Butters Stotch is ignored although he is bleeding and severely injured. Several game shows have also mentioned Jackson's performance.

Several presenters at award shows have referenced the incident, including Anna Nicole Smith at the first annual MTV Australia Video Music Awards, Dave Chappelle at the MTV Video Music Awards, and singer Alanis Morissette at the Juno Awards, commenting, ""It's disturbing and curious to me to see what came of that. We're all sexual beings, and if we don't let it out organically, we repress ourselves. If we repress anger, it turns to depression. If we repress our sexuality, it turns to pornography and rape. To think that the country was in an uproar because of a nipple.""[89][198] Comedian Russell Brand referenced the incident when hosting the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, saying ""I can almost guarantee a Janet Jackson-style Super Bowl nip slip.""[199]

Legacy [ edit ]

The Super Bowl XXXVIII incident is considered to be the most controversial television and media event to occur within popular culture, and Jackson was regarded as the world's ""most controversial musician"" who was ""changing the cultural landscape"" due to the incident's massive effect on censorship and broadcasting in television and entertainment.[200] The performance incident made ""Janet Jackson"" the most searched term, event and image in Internet history.[21][22] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as ""Most Searched in Internet History"" and the ""Most Searched for News Item"".[26] It also broke the record for ""most searched event over one day"".[25] 'Janet Jackson' also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year.[23][24] It also set a record for being the most watched, recorded and replayed moment on TiVo.[201] A company representative stated ""The audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it. The audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram.""[28] Monte Burke of Forbes magazine reported, ""[t]he fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up.""[29] Janet's Super Bowl halftime incident also coined the phrase ""wardrobe malfunction"", which was later officially added to the Webster's English Dictionary in 2008.[30] In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Entertainment Weekly stated ""Radio stations rushed to add Jackson's new single, ""Just a Little While"" to playlists on Monday following the incident [...] And USA Today reports that jewelry stores and piercing studios are seeing increased customer interest in silver sunburst-shaped nipple shields.""[49]

YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim revealed that his frustration at not being able to easily find a video clip of the incident provided the inspiration for the creation of YouTube, and later of Vevo.[19] The launch of Facebook commenced three days following the incident, in a potential attempt to capitalize on its publicity through social networking.[8]

Rolling Stone stated Jackson's Super Bowl performance ""is far and away the most famous moment in the history of the Super Bowl halftime show"".[202] PopCrush called the performance ""one of the most shocking moments in pop culture"" as well as a ""totally unexpected and unforgettable moment"".[203] Gawker ranked the performance among the most recent of the ""10 Shows that Advanced Sex on Television"", commenting the set ""had all the elements of a huge story"" and ""within seconds the world searched furtively for pictures"", concluding ""it remains so ubiquitous, it's impossible to look at a starburst nipple shield without thinking ""Janet Jackson"""".[204] E! Online ranked it among the top ten most shocking celebrity moments of the prior two decades.[181] A study of television's most impactful moments of the last 50 years conducted by Sony Electronics and the Nielsen Television Research Company ranked Jackson's Super Bowl performance at #26. The incident was the only Super Bowl event on the list and the highest music and entertainment event aside from the death of Whitney Houston.[205] TV Guide Network ranked it at #2 in a 2010 special listing the ""25 Biggest TV Blunders"".[206] Complex stated ""It's the Citizen Kane of televised nip-slips – so unexpected, and on such a large stage, that nothing else will ever come close. If Beyoncé were to whip out both breasts and put on a puppet show with them when she performs this year in New Orleans, it would rate as just the second most shocking Super Boob display. Janet's strangely ornamented right nipple is a living legend, and so is Justin Timberlake's terrified reaction.""[207] Music channel Fuse listed it as the most controversial Super Bowl halftime show, saying the ""revealing performance remains (and will forever remain) the craziest thing to ever happen at a halftime show. Almost immediately after the incident, the FCC received a flood of complaints from parents who just wanted their children to enjoy a nice, wholesome three hours of grown men inflicting damaging and long-lasting pain on each other for sport. Halftime shows would never be the same.""[208] Patrick Gipson of Bleacher Report ranked it as #1 in its list of the most ""Jaw Dropping Moments of the Last Decade"", stating Janet ""changed the landscape of live television forever"". Gipson explained ""It prompted a million mothers to cover their childrens' eyes, fathers and sons to jump out of their seats in shock and numerous sanctions by the Federal Communications Commission, including a US$550,000 fine against CBS. Talk about a halftime show that will be hard to top.""[209] The incident was also declared ""the most memorable Super Bowl halftime show in history"", as well as ""the most controversial"", adding ""you can't talk about this halftime show, or any subsequent halftime show from here to eternity, without mentioning the wardrobe malfunction"".[210]

Lamar Odom spotted partying it up in a strip club — Is Khloe Kardashian’s ex-husband back to his old ways? by Shaunee Flowers

If Blac Chyna wants to win her lawsuit against the Kardashians, she better make sure they can’t dig up any dirt on her.

Blac Chyna is suing the Kardashians for millions after claiming they have slut shamed her and shut down production on her reality show Rob & Chyna. In response, the Kardashians have done something that they are known for and Chyna should have seen it coming.

The Kardashians hired a private investigator to follow Blac Chyna. Certainly, they’re hoping that an investigator can dig up enough dirt to either prove Chyna wrong or to make her not want to continue with her lawsuit. Whichever way gets this hanger-on off the Kardashians backs is probably okay with them.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BayH3W1FSqS/?hl=en&taken-by=blacchyna

This isn’t the first time that one of the Kardashians hired a private investigator to follow around the partner or former partner of one of the KUWTK stars. Remember several seasons ago when Kim Kardashian hired someone to follow Scott Disick around when she thought he was up to something shady.

That drama played out over several episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and featured plenty of confrontations between Kim and Scott about it.

This time around, it’s not quite as cute as the former KUWTK storyline. As a matter of fact, this isn’t a storyline for the show at all and is something that the Kardashians tried to avoid when Rob started dating Chyna. It’s crazy how much chaos one person can cause for a family in such a short amount of time.

According to Radar Online, this time around, it’s Kris Jenner who was put in charge of the spying. Khloe and Kourtney are reportedly helping their mom with the private investigator and Kim is supportive.

The actual dollar amount wasn’t shared but it was reported that Kris has spent “a small fortune” hiring the best PIs that money can buy in order to find something, anything that will get Blac Chyna off their backs.

“It was Kris’ idea to hire private detectives to tail Chyna’s every move, take pictures and damaging video,” a source reportedly told Radar. “They’ve got the inside track of what Chyna’s doing 24/7 and won’t rest until they see Chyna go down in flames.”

Back when Rob Kardashian started dating Blac Chyna, the family was afraid that it would end something like this. Rob was obviously an easy target and Chyna has shown time and time again that when one money scheme fails, she’s got several other ideas.

This is what sisters are for ❤️ Don't miss @nbcthisisus when it returns tomorrow at 9/8c only on @nbc! A post shared by Kardashians on E! (@kuwtk) on Sep 25, 2017 at 2:09pm PDT

Much like her lawsuits against the Kardashians. At first, it was all about Dream Kardashian and child support. Once that was settled and Chyna got less than she wanted, she waged a flurry of lawsuits against Rob and the Kardashian family as a whole.

Blac Chyna wants to ensure she gets rich off her time with the Kardashians and she’s going to fight tooth and nail until she gets that payout. Likewise, the Kardashians are so upset about what she’s doing and the PR nightmare that this has caused that they want to make sure she walks away with as little as possible.

Want your voice heard? Join the Kardashian Dish team! Write for us!

The war between Blac Chyna and the Kardashians is probably going to get a lot messier before it ends. When all the dust settles and Chyna runs out of things to sue for, she may find that she would have been better off if she had left the KUWTK family alone from the start.",0
241,"The Enduring Appeal of the Fairy-Tale Wedding For those aspiring fairy-tale brides unable to shell out $180,000—which is what Disney’s ultimate fairy tale will set you back—there are other, cheaper ways to feel like a princess. After their weddings, according to Otnes, Princess Diana and Kate Middleton each transformed the wedding-dress industry. “Diana got married in a big, poofy dress with puffed sleeves, Kate in a lacy, fitted gown. The dresses became immediate sources of emulation. There is a reason everyone is waiting with bated breath to find out what Meghan will wear,” said Otnes (who will be celebrating the wedding with her colleagues, wearing fascinator hats and enjoying a British high tea).

The fairy-tale wedding dates back to 15th-century Venice, when a writer named Giovanni Francesco Straparola invented what is now recognized as the standard happy ending. “Before this point, at the end of fairy tales, you had the prince and princess living as hermits, not getting married, waiting to receive their ultimate rewards in heaven,” said Ruth Bottigheimer, a professor at Stony Brook University who specializes in fairy tales. “The new happy ending takes place here on earth, and it takes the shape of a wedding.” Classic fairy-tale weddings involve at least one royal, Bottigheimer said, “because that’s where the money is—the power.” In mid-19th-century Germany, the era of the Brothers Grimm, fairy tales were widely taught in schools. At that point, Bottigheimer said, “the happily-ever-after plot gets injected into the whole European population.”

The fairy-tale wedding—as a consumable good, not a fictional happy ending—arrived in the United States in the 1950s, says Stephanie Coontz, a professor of marriage and family history at Evergreen State College. When World War II ended, marriage rates skyrocketed. Women, employed during the war while the men were away, left the workplace in droves and got married. In 1950, the average age of marriage for women was 20. “If you waited four or five years after that, you’d be labeled a spinster,” Coontz said. In the midst of that pressure, the wedding industry identified an enormous opportunity, using ads to convince women that their wedding would be the biggest day of their lives. At the same time, Disney debuted its rendition of the world’s most famous fictional princess: When it came out in 1950, Cinderella—which ends, of course, in a gilded royal wedding—was, by one count, the highest-grossing film of the year. And so began what Coontz calls “the relentless pursuit of the princess.”

There was something special about Cinderella. In the sweet girl next door who talks to birds and sleeps in the kitchen, Coontz told me, women saw themselves. “This idea that someone who can support you at that level of opulence chooses you, instead of a blue blood … that is a very attractive fantasy,” Coontz says. Particularly after Grace Kelly—another “commoner” (who, yes, happened to be a wildly famous actress)—married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, the fairy-tale wedding suddenly felt, well, if not within reach, then at least something worth fantasizing about. The most recent royal marriages, according to Coontz, have been so popular because they play out the same storyline: Rich, royal dude swoops in to save a regular girl from a lifetime of oppressive normality. (Both Middleton and Markle were considered “commoners” at the time of their engagements, though genealogists have since claimed distant royal ties.) “In the past, kings and princes couldn’t marry commoners, so there was no point in fantasizing about it much,” Coontz said. “Now we’ve seen the idea of a ‘love match’ become a reality.”",0
242,"Khloe Kardashian seems to have well and truly shut down Tristan Thompson marriage rumours Khloe Kardashian is officially not here to take anyone’s shit. And we love her for it.

Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.

“Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”

Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”

In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?

Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…

First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”

Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”

Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”

And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”

Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?",0

245,"Can growing up without a father be a gift? Jay-Z thinks so Can growing up without a father be a gift? That’s how Jay-Z counterintuitively described it, in his autobiography. “We were kids without fathers … and in a way, that was a gift,” the rapper and businessman writes in Decoded. “We got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves.”

Low-income black fathers want to be good dads. The system won't let them | Kirk E Harris Read more

If you choose the right inspirations, growing up without a dad can be a gift. But, as the title of Jay-Z’s album Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse suggests, there’s a flip side. Many of us who spend Father’s Day wishing we had somebody to celebrate with haven’t chosen the right influences as substitutes. We might not be making many choices at all.

I grew up without a father regularly in my life. I would leave my mom’s house every morning searching for what was missing at home – the role models who could show me how to be a man. Like many kids in the same situation – and many of my peers were fatherless – I found those role models on television and in music.

Jay-Z was one of them: the pre-Beyoncé Jay-Z of the late 1990s and early 2000s, big pimpin’ and trading disses with fellow New York rapper Nas. His tough-guy bravado, glorification of crime, flashy jewelry and videos full of dancing women captivated me. I tried my best to emulate him and other rappers. My friends and I wanted to use drugs and thought selling them was cool; we got into fights, skipped classes and in some cases dropped out altogether. Studying seemed boring when compared with the gangster fairytales we shared. Delayed gratification, which is vital to living life with long-term benefits in mind, was a foreign concept.

My father didn’t know how to be a husband to my mom or a dad to me. He had no examples from his past or his present

I have no interest in blaming Jay-Z – or any other man – for playing a role in my life he didn’t ask for. My father uniquely carried the responsibility of setting an example for me. But he, too, had fallen to the curse of fatherlessness. Born an orphan in Kenya, he was re-orphaned at 14 when his adoptive parents passed away. He persevered, working his way from an apprentice at the Hilton Hotel in Nairobi to a chef at the Hilton Hotel in London by the time he was 21. When the time came for him to have a family of his own, however, the curse caught up with him. He didn’t know how to be a husband to my mom or a dad to me. He had no examples from his past or his present to provide guidance. Unlike the years my father spent training with other chefs to learn how to succeed in the kitchen, he had no role models to show him how to be a family man. It didn’t take long for my father to give up and disappear.

My family is not alone in experiencing the curse of growing up without a dad in the house. Fatherless children are more likely to use drugs or alcohol, repeat grades in school, become teenage parents, go to prison and engage in criminal or other delinquent behaviours. A 2013 literature review by researchers from Princeton, Cornell and Berkeley universities concluded: “We find strong evidence that father absence negatively affects children’s social-emotional development, particularly by increasing externalizing behavior [such as aggression and attention seeking].” The review also notes these affects may be more pronounced for boys than girls.



Evidently, it’s not easy to fill the void – but even easier to find the wrong influences. Kids today are exposed to a much broader range of media technologies than I was in the 1990s through which to find examples for what a “man” is. Online communities formed through social media and discussion boards can exert their own kind of masculine peer pressure: incel (“involuntarily celibate”) culture, which became the subject of international media coverage after this year’s mass murders in Parkland, Florida, and my hometown, Toronto, is an example of how young men can develop resentful, angry and self-victimizing masculine identities while having these identities reinforced by an online peer group.

As president, Barack Obama made it a priority to deliberately and strategically steer vulnerable young men away from the negative influences that affect fatherless kids. His initiative My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) galvanized foundations, businesses, local governments and community groups to promote a milestones-based example for young men to follow, including reading at grade level by grade three, attending postsecondary education and staying out of the criminal justice system.

MBK offered a way to identify healthy role models at different stages of a young man’s life without being overly exclusive in defining who and what a man can be. MBK was renamed just before Obama left the White House and seems to have gone quiet as a federal government initiative. It continues as a non-governmental organization.

My search for role models wasn’t as deliberate or strategic as Obama advocates for, but after years of trial and error I was able to find positive role models in community college and then university. In particular, professors showed me how learn to read and write effectively, built my self-esteem and encouraged me to find new peer groups. Professors also connected me with role models in books, such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Booker T Washington, Marcus Garvey and WEB Du Bois, who demonstrated the diversity of ways men can and do exist in the world. With the right support, not having a dad became an opportunity for me to choose positive inspirations.

Knowing that others are fighting a legacy of fatherlessness in their own lives motivates me to continue believing

A few weeks into my first semester at Yale law school, Jay-Z published his autobiography. It turned out he had transformed over the same period of time I had. In an interview about his book, he recalled the lyrics to one of his songs that I loved as a kid (Big Pimpin’) and confessed: “I can’t believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?”

Today, Jay-Z’s example as a husband and father, detailed in last year’s album 4:44, helps me when thinking about how to be a good partner to my girlfriend and a good father figure to her son, responsibilities for which I often feel deeply unprepared. Knowing that others are fighting a legacy of fatherlessness in their own lives motivates me to continue believing, trying and learning.



For those of us lucky enough to eventually see growing up without a dad as a positive opportunity, the challenge remains for us to help more fatherless kids find life’s gifts and escape its curses.",0

According to a slew of speculative and incorrect stories, Berry is expecting her third child and debuted a “baby bump” at the 16th Annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in Los Angeles. The Mirror, for example, wrote that the actress appeared on the “red carpet proudly cradling a ‘baby bump.'” The British tabloid further claimed Berry “has yet to publicly announce her pregnancy.” “When she stood to the side, the bump was even more apparent, and Halle made no effort to conceal her new curves,” added the misguided newspaper.

Similarly, the fake news manufacturers at HollywoodLife maintained Berry is going to “be a mama for the third time around!” They also cut-and-pasted the phrase that wrongfully alleged the actress was “cradling a baby bump on the carpet.” Since HollywoodLies often speculates rather than actually reports, the repeatedly discredited outlet asserted that that Berry had “quite a glow about her as she rested her hands on the apparent bump with a huge smile on her face.”",0

All told, they gave more than $8 million in donations in 2006, with Pitt putting in $4,402,317, and Jolie donating $4,123,613, the Huffington Post reports, citing newly released federal tax filings. (These latest figures don’t include 2007 – in which, among other charitable efforts, Brad’s Make It Right Foundation raised $5 million.)

In terms of dispensing their funds, according to records for 2006, the foundation handed out $2,367,935, including $1 million to both Doctors Without Borders (International Division) and to the Global Action for Children.

Additional gifts included $137,935 to the Namibia Red Cross Action Program (their daughter Shiloh was born in the African country); $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation (the late journalist’s widow, Marianne Pearl, was played by Jolie in A Mighty Heart); $100,000 to Global Green U.S.A. and to the Epidermolysis Bulloma Medical Research Foundation.

In addition, $20,000 went to an art park in Los Angeles, as did separate $5,000 donations to two orphanages that Jolie had visited.

In terms of Pitt’s work in Louisiana, Jolie’s costar in the movie Wanted, Morgan Freeman, told PEOPLE Thursday at the Pathfinders to Peace Forum and Gala, “We were in contact with Brad about the situation in New Orleans” – and he called Jolie “such a wonderful woman.”

Said Freeman: “Aside from all that physical beauty, she’s a real person.”

249,"Sofia Coppola triumphs with The Beguiled, a suspenseful Civil War revenge comedy The Beguiled masquerades as a Southern Gothic tale, with all the requisite grotesquerie. But beneath its frilly, corseted bodice, it’s a stone-cold revenge fantasy, laced with a potent cocktail of toxic comedy and pungent desire.

The film’s fixation on revenge means it feels considerably tighter and simpler than its marketing might have led you to believe. This isn’t the wild, extravagant romp of director Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette, nor does it lean so plainly on the hormonal teenage angst of The Virgin Suicides. Simple, irresistible desire is what drives revenge movies — desire for retribution, inexorably enacted. And The Beguiled is set at Miss Martha Farnsworth’s Seminary for Young Ladies, a hotbed of sublimated desire and good breeding. (Following the film’s premiere at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Coppola became the second woman in Cannes history to win the Best Director award.)

Rating vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark

In her adaptation of Thomas Cullinan’s Civil War-set 1961 novel — on which a 1971 Don Siegel film, starring Clint Eastwood, was also based — Coppola turns Miss Martha’s Seminary into a secluded, mist-heavy wood between the worlds, populated by women rendered helpless by the Civil War and scarce resources to do anything but pray and wait it out.

In The Beguiled, women are frustrated at being left to flap in the wind like a lacy frock on a clothesline, while the boys go out to fight the real war. But society requires them to remain civilized, embroidering in the drawing room to the sound of booming cannon fire on the battlefield beyond the seminary’s gates. They’re reduced to praying for the soldiers, hiding their cow so nobody steals it, and trying to keep away from the gaze of the men who march by, lest they be tempted.

Years of that kind of thing can make you crazy, or it can be a clarifying force. In The Beguiled, much of the fun (and suspense) comes from trying to guess which is the case.

The Beguiled takes place late in the Civil War, when ennui has set in

The sister to The Beguiled in Coppola’s oeuvre is certainly The Virgin Suicides, another film about a house full of young women held captive for their own good (and in which Kirsten Dunst also starred). In that film, the girls are hungry for male interaction, partly because they want to have sex and partly because they’re just desperate for an outlet and an escape from their intense loneliness.

Those elements are in The Beguiled, for sure. But they’re best taken with the historical context in mind, and what the characters are experiencing from their secluded vantage point: the dismay of knowing their social order is disappearing, and the dreariness of living from day to day with nothing to do but keep at the embroidery, practice conjugating French verbs, maybe practice the violin.

The story picks up three years after the secession, when pigtailed Amy (Oona Laurence), gathering mushrooms in the Virginia woods, stumbles upon a wounded Union soldier, Corporal John McBurney (Colin Farrell). She brings him back to the sprawling house that’s home to the seminary and its headmistress, Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman, in one of her four roles at Cannes this year).

Most of the seminary’s students have gone home because of the war, but Edwina Morrow (a subdued Dunst) has stayed on as a teacher, and a cadre of other girls remains, stranded by the dangerous situation in their own hometowns across the war-torn South. The oldest of these girls is Alicia (Elle Fanning), a 19th-century version of Virgin Suicides’ Lux Lisbon (played by Dunst in that film), all flirtation and seduction.

The residents of the seminary first consider turning Cpl. McBurney over to soldiers — either his own or theirs — but appealing to “Christian charity,” they elect instead to bring him inside and tend to his wounded leg. Miss Martha puts him under with chloroform, then cleans the wound and stitches it up. And then, while he’s still out, she strips him down to his knickers and washes him off, pausing to take more than a few deep breaths.

All the women and girls are worried about him in the house, but when he wakes up, relations slowly improve between the affable McBurney and the women, particularly the oldest three: strong-willed, mature Miss Martha, quiet and dutiful Edwina, and precociously tantalizing Alicia, who all but winks at him the moment he sets eyes on her.

But it gradually becomes clear that McBurney (an Irishman fresh off the boat from Dublin who took a man’s place in the army for $300) fancies himself a charmer, and that he’s found himself in a rather ideal situation: surrounded by beautiful women and charming girls of all ages and personalities. And he’d rather not go back to the army anyway.

Naturally, he plays the field. Let’s just say it doesn’t end well.

In The Beguiled, Coppola plays with the look of the film to add to the story

Coppola again wields her talent for stylizing films to set up our expectations for The Beguiled. The Spanish moss and mist hangs heavily over the trees, as in a twisted fairy tale, the colors are a little washed out, and the edges of the frame are darkened slightly, all signifying a decaying Confederacy and its carefully tended social niceties, which Miss Martha is still trying so desperately to preserve.

But this is a comedy — a dark one, but a comedy nonetheless, in which a candlelit dinner table becomes a minefield of dramatic irony. So lest we take things too seriously, Coppola employs a pink cursive script for the title card, embellished with flourishes and compressed slightly from both ends. It calls to mind a trashy and inconsequential romance novel, which, when punctuated with the film’s moments of violence, wounds, and blood, feels more hilarious than horrifying.

In fact, it’s the mashed up stylistic markers of The Beguiled that make it so effective, especially as they skitter across the revenge plot humming along beneath the surface. As a film, The Beguiled is thrilling, delicious, wicked fun. But there’s also something purely pleasurable — and no less cathartic in the 21st century than it might have been in the 19th — to see a cowardly man with far too much self-regard and far too few scruples get what he deserves.

The Beguiled premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 24 (this review was originally published during the festival) and opens in US theaters on June 23.",0
250,"Game of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo finale twist revealed The HBO mammoth hit’s final episode will be a very sad day for devoted Game of Thrones fans, but it’s sure to be a cracker that ties up all the loose ends. One of the major questions on everybody’s lips is what will happen to fan-favourite characters Daenerys (played by Emilia Clarke) and Jon Snow (Kit Harington). The pair joined forces as allies in the final episodes of season seven before taking things to the next level to become lovers, but fans can’t forget about the mother of dragons’ first love Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), who died in season two. After watching season two episode ten, one fan put the startling pieces together to form an incredible theory for a Drogo return, despite the fact he and their son died.

Posting on fan forum site Reddit, the fan claimed one moment could be a huge foreshadowing for season eight. User Bronn of The Blackwater wrote: “I’m currently doing a re-watch, and I just finished watching S02E10. I just realised that Daenerys’ vision might be a big foreshadow. “In her vision, Dany sees the iron throne, she reached for it, but then decided to go north of the wall and found Khal Drogo with her son. “I think the first part already happened: Dany had the opportunity to seize the throne, by fighting Cersei [Lannister], but decided to go North instead to help Jon Snow fight the Night King.” The fan went on to speculate Daenerys will die in the show’s final episode, but it will be a bittersweet ending for the character?

They continued: “So, maybe the second part of the vision will happen in season eight and Daenerys will join Drogo and her son by dying because she decides to go north.” Elsewhere, HBO may have accidentally revealed the fates of King of the North Jon and his little sister Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner). The American network released a first look at the pair in the latest offering of the fantasy drama, and it looks like there’s trouble ahead for the duo. Sansa could be set to betray her older brother as the camera zooms in on the Lady of Winterfell’s face and she appears incredibly tense. Viewers can see Sansa embracing her brother tightly, but as she looks over his shoulder, her face darkens and it’s clear the character is hiding something.

He posted a side-by-side photo where he is kicking it back to his old school days in the ’90s when he rocked a turtleneck, baggy jeans and a fanny pack. Let’s not overlook his gorgeous hair!

The split photo might inspire some chuckles, that’s for sure! The feeling behind the Baywatch star’s photos actually packs a punch.

The actor takes note of where he came from over twenty years ago, and he also highlights where he is today. That is – the highest paid actor in the whole world.

The Rock, whose net worth is somewhere around $190 million began his lengthy Instagram post by saying that “When I took this iconic absurdity of a picture in 1996, I was one year removed from sleeping on a used mattress I took from a garbage dumpster in the back of an hourly sex motel. Couldn’t afford to buy a bed so we do what we gotta do to get by.”

“You can imagine all the fun colorful bodily fluids I tried my best to clean off, ” he continued.

The 45-year-old also said that he is now, after 21 years, taking the same photo backstage as he is hosting Saturday Night Live for the fifth time.

The actor told the world that “If you’re going thru your own tough times ‘used mattress’ stage, do your best to have faith things’ll get better and always be willing to outwork your competition because you never know where life is gonna take you.”

His post is both humorous and inspiring, and we congratulate him for this.

He also told his fans that they should always remember to put a soft tissue under their left elbow for protecting the fabric of the “cheap ass swag” turtleneck that makes you look like a “bad ass buff lesbian.”

He advises people to tuck the thumb in the fanny pack as it’s a critical thig to do and this must not be forgotten under any circumstance. These are some sage words, Dwayne, and we totally agree! Keep up the good work, and keep on rocking your looks!",1

Perrette, whose character was mugged during last week's episode, told USA Today fans will need ""a couple boxes of tissues"" Tuesday.

256,"'This Is Us' just revealed a major clue about Jack's death; here's everything we know so far Most of us didn't sign up for a whodunit when we began watching NBC's ""This Is Us,"" but it's sort of turning into one. The big, gaping plot hole that the show builds around is just how perfect-specimen-of-a-dad Jack Pearson met his maker.

""Before this season is over we will see how Jack Pearson dies,"" Sterling K. Brown said on the Golden Globes red carpet. Then Milo Ventimiglia on Saturday told Us Weekly the cause of Jack's death would be revealed ""very, very, very, very soon.""

While Tuesday's episode didn't completely divulge the backstory, it did reveal one more crucial piece of information. (Spoilers ahead!)

In the beginning of ""Clooney,"" Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Jack (Ventimiglia) list items they need to buy at the mall -- batteries for Rebecca, a suit for Jack -- in what turns into quite the dramatic trip. Then off they go! Teenage Kate has a meltdown in a fitting room. Teenage Kevin drowns his injury-related sorrows with chicken wings then gets teary-eyed with dad. Teenage Randall asks a girl out using the ol' personalized Magic 8-ball trick (the kid's a genius).

Back at home, Rebecca and Jack share a heartfelt moment after all that heavy-duty parenting. All seems well. Then Rebecca asks Jack if they forgot anything at the mall. Nope, he doesn't think so. Suddenly, we cut to a close-up shot of the smoke detector.

NO. NO. NO.

Rebecca had told Jack not to let her forget the batteries. Then they both forgot. Combine this with what we've learned so far, and the pieces are clearly falling into place.

Jack's death was so traumatic that the family, in present day, can't talk about it. Heck, Kate hasn't even told the man she's going to marry what exactlyhappened. So the importance to the ""This Is Us"" story rests not just with the actual manner of Jack's death, but the circumstances surrounding it. The Rebecca-battery connection is one more addition to this.

Here's a rundown of what we've learned about Jack's death so far, in chronological order by episode:

Season 1, Episode 5: ""The Game Plan""

Can you even remember a time before you realized Jack wasn't still alive? Well, this major plot point wasn't revealed until five episodes in, when Kate tells Toby that she likes to watch the Steelers games at home alone with her dad. Her dad, in this case, being the urn of his ashes she keeps on her mantle.

Season 1, Episode 6: ""Career Days""

Kevin inadvertently crashes a memorial service, and ends up talking with the man's widow about her 15-year-old son. During the conversation, he reveals he used to build model planes and boats with Jack -- ""I used to pick the most complex ones,"" Kevin explains, ""because they took the longest. I was one of three kids so you really had to strategize to get your alone time with dad.""

While the pair eventually had a fleet of models, Kevin threw them all away after Jack died. ""I threw every one of them away, and I don't know why I did that,"" Kevin says. When asked how old he was, he simply responds, ""It was a long time ago.""

Kevin points to his necklace as belonging to Jack's. ""It's the only thing I have left of him."" It's a detail that maybe didn't fully register with viewers this early in the series, but it became clearer in Season 2.

Season 1, Episode 13: ""Three Sentences""

This is the first time we get a sense of when Jack died. This episode ends with scenes from Jack's funeral, including Rebecca and her kids mourning. Kate, Kevin and Randall are clearly teenagers.

Season 1, Episode 17: ""What Now?""

""You remember when I told you I couldn't talk about my dad's death?"" Kate tells Toby. ""Well, that's because it's my fault ... I'm the reason that he's dead.""

When she says these words, the flashback cuts to Jack thanking Kate for encouraging him to surprise Rebecca at an out-of-town gig. We're sort of led to believe that maybe something horrible happens on this trip. But we later discover that isn't the case, so Kate's feelings of guilt remain a mystery to viewers.

Season 2, Episode 1: ""A Father's Advice"" OK.

This is the big one when we see the immediate aftermath of Jack's death.

Rebecca is driving while wearing a Steelers jersey (the team, if you remember, are pretty important in Jack and Rebecca's relationship). The passenger seat holds a plastic bag with a few things presumably belonging to Jack: a watch, a set of keys, an American flag key chain, a wedding ring and a notebook. The items all seem unscathed and undamaged.

The kids, meanwhile, are at Miguel's house. Kate cries into her dog, and Randall weeps while holding the hand of a redheaded girl. Miguel, teary-eyed, shows up with linens and says he's going to find pillows.

""We have to find Kev,"" a crying Kate tells Randall. ""He needs to hear it from me."" Kevin, meanwhile, is shown in his letterman jacket, with a cast and on crutches, kissing a girl (Sophie, the love of his life, right?).

Then we cut back to Rebecca pulling over to the side of a road. She looks at the red mailbox reading ""Pearson,"" and the house completely gutted by a fire, and loses all composure, yelling and beating the steering wheel. The caution tape is still up, and a few firefighters assess the scene.

Season 2, Episode 8: ""Number One""

It doesn't seem much is left of Jack, physically. Kevin has a meltdown when he realizes, in his rush to get more painkillers, he's likely left his father's necklace at the home of the woman he just slept with and walked out on after stealing her prescription pad.

""That necklace is the only thing I have left in my life from my dad,"" Kevin cries out in desperation. ""It's the only thing I have.""

Season 2, Episodes 8, 9 and 10: ""Number One,"" ""Number Two,"" ""Number Three""

We see the same day replay in these three episodes, including the lights cutting out in the Pearson house.

""Jack! Fuse!"" Rebecca cries out. ""Yup, I'm working on it,"" Jack yells back. Rebecca puts lit candles all around the house. Once the lights kick back up, Jack says, ""I think the power's gonna hold.""

Could it be a case of faulty wiring that burned the house down? Or all those candles? Or something else? And if so, why would Jack die in the house fire?

Season 2, episode 12: ""Clooney""

As noted above, in this episode we're left with what feels like a big detail: The smoke detector needed replacement batteries.",1

The American actress, 41 - who endured a very public and difficult break-up with Brad Pitt in September, has her 'sights set on' an extremely private Cecil B. DeMille estate in the gated community of Los Feliz, California.

The residence boasts quite the backstory, as it was previously owned by famed filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, who was dubbed as the 'founding father of US cinema' for 40 years until his death in 1959.

Hot property: Angelina Jolie, 41, is said to be eyeing up a historic mansion, which is worth just under $25 million - following her public split with Brad Pitt in September of last year

A source did little to dispel the rumours by telling Page Six that the Lara Croft actress 'wants to make this her new home'.

If mother-of-six Angelina makes the decision to purchase the Beaux Arts mansion, which was built in 1913, her clan will have more than enough space for their needs.

The house boasts six bedrooms, ten bathrooms and is located on 2.1 elevated acres in the stunning gated community of Laughlin Park.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Angelina for further comment.

This comes after Angelina and her ex Brad agreed to part with their country estate and vineyard in the South of France following their divorce last year.

It served as the venue for their 2014 wedding and gave them a bolthole away from the cameras for them and their children.

Sources told US Weekly in October that Chateau Miraval 'has been valued and is going on the market any day now.'

The 1,200-acre property was purchased by the now estranged couple for an estimated $60 million back in 2012. They had previously leased it starting in 2008.

'It currently says 'Jolie-Pitt' on the Château Miraval bottles, and the next season's batch will have a new reprinted label with no names written on it,' sources told Us Weekly.

Meanwhile, the exes have finally seemed to call it truce for the sake of their brood - Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, aged eight.

Brad, 53, recently flew to Cambodia to attend the the premiere of Angelina's new film First They Killed My Father.

261,"Calvin Klein cast the Kardashian (and Jenner) sisters for its new campaign Since the #MYCALVINS campaign kicked off last year, it has seen a rollout of some of music and fashion’s brightest stars take centre stage. The first instalment of the campaign saw Solange, Kelela and Dev Hynes model both denim and underwear into one whilst the second instalment saw A$AP Rocky and his A$AP Mob swag their way through a barn in the famous jeans. The most recent edition saw supermodel Cindy Crawford’s children Kaia and Presley Gerber show us what it means to be family – the main focus of the campaign.

When it comes to famous families there probably isn’t one that stands out more than the Kardashians (even if it is just because you love to hate them), making them the perfect choice to front the latest set of images. Fronted by the Kardashian and Jenner sisters (Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie if you needed reminding), it sees them in white underwear lounging on a giant blanket from the SS18 show.

Elsewhere, Kim wears a Canadian Tux (double denim if you’re not familiar) and Kylie sports a matching black and white set from the runway show. Although Khloe and Kourtney have not been the faces of any high fashion campaigns before, Kim starred in Balmain’s AW16 campaign alongside husband Kanye. Kylie and Kendall also fronted the AW15 season for the Parisian house. Not to mention Marc Jacobs, Fendi, Givenchy under Kendall’s belt too.

The campaign drops at a time where rumours are circling as to whether Kylie is pregnant or not. Eagle-eyed fans will note that she is pictured artfully covering her stomach with a CK blanket. Conspiracy?! No doubt Kris’s plan for the family (and new baby – hi Chicago!) will be unveiled soon. Meanwhile, the campaign will continue to run throughout the season.

While she didn't outwardly address her now ex husband's split from Lambert, she did take to social media to defend him right before news of the split went public.

But keep in mind, the Turnpike Troubadours canceled their final two shows on Miranda's tour BEFORE news of the breakup surfaced, so we are 99.99999 percent sure Staci was already aware of the breakup when she responded to a fan on Instagram.

NEW DELHI: The ‘Game of Thrones’ executive producer, David Benioff, has recently spoken on Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen’s “complicated” attraction.

Addressing the conflict between Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke’s characters on the show, Benioff said in the HBO-produced Inside the Episode that Jon Snow is there for political reasons - he wants to get dragon glass and if possible, convince Dany to become an ally, while Daenerys wants Jon to bend the knee.

""There's conflict and it's conflict between powerful people and then to make it all even more complicated, they're starting to be attracted to each other. So much of it is not from dialogue or anything we wrote. It's just the two of them in a small space, standing near each other, and us just watching that and feeling the heat of it,"" Benioff said.



Talking about Daenerys, co-creator D.B. Weiss added, ""She's in a position where if she doesn't step up soon and come up with a big win for her side, she's going to lose this fight before it even begins.”

""I think she really feels the pressure of her situation more than she ever has before. It's the fight she's been waiting for her whole life,"" he continued.",1
265,"""The Perfectionists"": Release Date, Cast, Plot, Trailer And Everything You Need To Know ""The Perfectionists"": Release Date, Cast, Plot, Trailer And Everything You Need To Know

By Katie Louise-Smith

Here's everything we know about the Pretty Little Liars spin-off, ""The Perfectionists"".

When Pretty Little Liars ended after 160 episodes on June 27, 2017, the fandom was heartbroken. How are we gonna live without knowing what happens to our favourite liars?! Thankfully, it was announced a few months later that a spin-off called The Perfectionists, adapted and produced by PLL show-runner I. Marlene King and based on the novel of the same name, would be making it's way to TV with Rosewood's very own Alison DiLaurentis and Mona Vanderwaal - and the fandom cannot wait.

The latest news? When it was announced that Sasha Pieterse would be reprising the role of Alison in the spin-off, many were left wondering why she moved across the country without fianceé Emily and the twins. King has now confirmed that we will find out why Allison moved away at some point during the first season. “You learn in the pilot why Alison is there, and what’s going on with her and Emily,” she shared with TVLine.

“We left her very happy with Emily and the twins, so to justify why she would leave that behind to come to Beacon Heights was worthy of much more conversation.”

A 10-episode season has been picked up by Freeform and the cast, including stars from Disney's The Descendants, Gossip Girl and The Walking Dead, has now been announced. Filming is due to begin in March and the show should be arriving on our screens at some point in 2019.

Freeform have also shared the first trailer for the series and you can watch it below:

When will The Perfectionists be released?

There is currently no official release date for The Perfectionists just yet but Sofia Carson confirmed in an interview that the show would be airing at some point in 2019.

In January, showrunner I. Marlene King revealed to ETOnline that ""the script is written and we're in the process of rewriting it just to fine tune it perfectly."" They were also reportedly scouting and locking down locations in the Pacific Northwest of the US, where the new town of Beacon Heights will be set. On February 27th, the cast attended their first table read with production due to begin the following week.

And so it begins... #plltheperfectionists A post shared by Sasha Pieterse (@sashapieterse27) onFeb 26, 2018 at 12:50pm PST

Where can I watch The Perfectionists?

The Perfectionists has now officially been picked up by Freeform for a 10-episode season so it will be available to watch on the same network as Pretty Little Liars.

Freeform

Who will be in the cast?

Sofia Carson (The Descendants) has been cast as Ava, a blogger and coder who strives to be a fashion icon and one of the series' main protagonists. She'll be joining Sasha Pieterse and Janel Parrish who will be reprising their roles as Alison DiLaurentis and Mona Vanderwaal from Pretty Little Liars.

Sydney Park, who fans of The Walking Dead will know as Cyndie, will be playing the role of Caitlin. Caitlin is described as smart, driven and someone who thrives under pressure. She's the perfect daughter of two perfect mothers who has set her sights on following in her mother’s Senatorial footsteps.

Also joining the cast is Gossip Girl legend Kelly Rutherford (Lily Van Der Woodsen) as Claire Hotchkiss, the mother of the murdered Nolan Hotchkiss. She, along with her husband, founded Hotchkiss Industries and Beacon Heights University. She believes “perfection is attainable and is the person who pulls the strings behind the scenes to get what she wants.”

Newcomer Eli Brown will play Dylan, a talented cellist who’s “deeply committed to his two passions, his music and his boyfriend Andrew.” And General Hospital's Hayley Erin has been cast in a ""mysterious, unnamed role.""

Sasha Pieterse and Janel Parrish will also be reprising their roles from Pretty Little Liars.

The three remaining protagonists in the story (Mackenzie, Julie and Parker) are all still yet to be cast. Fans have been sharing their dream casting for the roles online with AnnaSophia Robb, Jane Levy, McKaley Miller and Moon Ga Young emerging as fan favourites for the roles.

So far, no other casting details have been announced.

via giphy.com

Will there be any Pretty Little Liars characters in the cast? Will Shay Mitchell return as Emily?

As we said, Mona and Alison will be featured in the series. According to Sasha Pieterse, Alison is the main character on the show but whether or not Emily will appear in the spin-off remains to be seen. Shay Mitchell revealed that she had spoken to I. Marlene King about bringing Emily (and their babies) back together with Ali but added that scheduling difficulties might make it a little complicated.

“At the end of the day, regardless of whether I’m on it or not, I will 100-percent support the show and be a fan of it myself,"" she told TV Line.

King has revealed that there will be plenty of PLL characters popping up on the show from time to time. The jury is still out on Troian Bellisario's Spencer and Ashley Benson's Hanna but it's been confirmed that Lucy Hale will not be making an appearance, presumably because she'll be working on her brand new show, Life Sentence.

Freeform

What will happen in The Perfectionists? Will the show pick up from where Pretty Little Liars left off?

The synopsis for the pilot episode of the series reads: ""Everything about the town of Beacon Heights seems perfect, from their top-tier college to their overachieving residents. But nothing in Beacon Heights is as it appears to be. The stress of needing to be perfect leads to the town's first murder. Behind every Perfectionist is a secret, a lie and a needed alibi.""

The series will be set in a new fictional town of Beacon Heights, instead of Rosewood but according to King, the tone of the show is very similar to PLL.

""There is a big mystery, and there is a murder, and there are some characters who are a fractured group at the beginning of our story, and through a murder they become friends,"" King told TVLine. ""We're meeting four new characters who are Perfectionists — and one of them won't make it to the end of the pilot.""



Freeform

Is The Perfectionists based on a book?

Yes. The show will be based on 'The Perfectionists' (2014) and 'The Good Girls' (2015), both written by Sarah Shepard.

The stories follow the lives of Ava, Caitlin, Mackenzie, Julie and Parker who believe they have absolutely nothing in common (other than striving to be perfect), until they discover that they all hate the same guy, Nolan Hotchkiss, who's betrayed each of them before. They jokingly plan to kill him but when he turns up dead and murdered in the EXACT way they had described earlier, they all become prime suspects.

The books aren't actually connected to Pretty Little Liars in any way but King plans to incorporate the story into the PLL universe, which means the original source material won't be followed as closely.

King also plans to focus on more of the major male characters in the books by making them part of the main group. And of course, she will be intertwining PLL's Alison and Mona into the storylines. How they fit into the series' main mystery remains a... well, mystery.



Freeform

Will there be a time jump from the Liars finale to the start of The Perfectionists?

So far, no time jump has been revealed by King but don't be surprised if there is one.

During an interview with The Edit published on Thursday, June 29, the actress, who suffered an eating disorder herself in the past, said that people’s obsession with being thin is why the disease exists.

Celebrities’ Weight Loss and Transformations: Before and After Pictures

“I was leaving my apartment one day and someone I’ve known for a long time, my mom’s age, said to me, ‘Oh, wow, look at you!'” Collins told the site. “I tried to explain [I lost weight for a role] and she goes, ‘No! I want to know what you’re doing, you look great!’ I got into the car with my mom and said, ‘That is why the problem exists.’”

The role hit home for Collins, who previously revealed that she suffered an eating disorder.

“There’s a scene where I’m taking my clothes off to be weighed by Carrie Preston, my stepmom in the movie, who takes a photo on her phone and shows it to me. I didn’t think she’d actually take one but she did,” Collins recalled. “I saw myself in the photo and my heart dropped. So when my mom saw the film, she saw Lily’s reaction because she knows me the best.”

The scene caused her mom to breakdown.

“The first time she was a bit in shock,” Collins added of her mom’s reaction. “The second time I looked over at the end and she was sobbing; it really hit her hard.”

The Love, Rosie actress also told The Edit that she couldn’t book photoshoots in magazines because she was too skinny.

“I told my publicist that if I could snap my fingers and gain 10 pounds right that second, I would,” she concluded of the experience.

270,"Kris Jenner's Over-the-Top Christmas Decorations Are Rainbow-Themed This Year Kim Kardashian West knows that her mom puts the Kris in Krismas. On Thursday night, the reality star stopped by Kris Jenner's home to spread a little holiday cheer to her Snapchat followers by taking them on a tour of her momager's fully decked-out house and, in the process, proving that Jenner is a true Kris Kringle.

In the first video, Kardashian West walks up to Jenner's front door via a pathway lined with rainbow lights, palm trees dripping with strands of yellow lights, and a fleet of towering nutcrackers. ""My favorite thing to do is drive around the town and show my kids all the Christmas tree lights,"" Kardashian West said in the video. ""They haven't seen my mom's house decorated yet. She did a rainbow theme."" Inside the massive home, Kardashian West gasps in surprise and asks her kids if the two life-size animatronic reindeer standing guard by the fireplace are real. North and Saint inform their mom that the deer are, in fact, fake, with a voice sounding like it could be Saint's telling her that the deer can't be real because they're not walking. Fair point.

Kardashian West moves on to Jenner's foyer—you probably recognize its black and white tiled floor from countless other Kardashian-Jenner snapshots—where the huge one-of-a-kind red glass and metal bear that she ordered last year and said was her favorite Christmas decoration sits among several rainbow-lit Christmas trees. The rainbow lights are also draped along the banisters of the huge double staircase. ""So she did it differently this year: She used to do a huge tree, but now she's just doing four smaller trees, all in rainbow,"" Kardashian West says, before declaring the whole set-up ""really classic and pretty.""

Jenner's 2017 technicolor decor is markedly different from the classic red and green theme she used last year. In 2016, Jenner covered her entryway and foyer in lush greenery, and decorated her five massive Christmas trees in huge red patterned baubles. She filled her kitchen with huge clusters of red roses, and the dining room was set with red plaid placemats and napkins, with even more red roses filling vases and bowls along the table and dripping from the antler chandelier.

Kardashian West's own holiday decorating style served as a plot point on a recent installment of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. In the late November episode, while shopping for Christmas décor with older sister Kourtney, the mom-to-be accused her of ""totally copying"" her light design the previous year. Later in the episode, Kardashian West turned on Jenner, too, claiming that her mom used the exact same festive wrapping paper as her in 2016. ""I have warned everyone that I will come for them if they even dare try to copy anything that I'm doing this holiday season,"" she said.",1
271,"Harvey Weinstein pleads not guilty to rape charges in court New York (CNN) Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to three felony counts in New York Supreme Court.

The disgraced producer walked into court for an arraignment on two counts of rape and one first-degree criminal sex act charge.

Weinstein denied all allegations of nonconsensual sexual activity, and he's remained free after posting $1 million cash bail, according to his attorney, Benjamin Brafman.

""Under the circumstances, he's holding up reasonably well. No one can be happy to be in the position that he is in,"" Brafman said Tuesday outside court.

""As terrible a crime as rape is, it is equally reprehensible to be falsely accused of rape, and since Mr. Weinstein has denied these allegations, that's where we are,"" he added.

272,"This Timeline Of Khloe Kardashian's Pregnancy Shows It's Really Been A Wild Ride Now that Khloé Kardashian has gone public with her pregnancy news, it's so much fun to watch her on social media and tear paparazzi apart for following her around the airport when she feels like dirt. But remember, there was a long, dark time when us fans weren't really sure whether she was expecting a baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson or not. Now that we know a baby is really, truly on the way, let's all take a walk down memory lane with a timeline of Khloé Kardashian's pregnancy. Because we'll never not get sick of her and this exciting journey.

Fans of Khloé in particular were very, very excited about the pregnancy rumors when they surfaced because they knew that she had been thinking about a having a baby for some time. On Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she not only fussed over all of her baby nieces and nephews but talked openly about wanting to be a mom one day.

It goes all the way back to her whirlwind marriage to Lamar Odom and their subsequent divorce. Remember when her sisters used to bug her about when the couple was going to have kids way before they, or the world, knew that Odom was struggling with substance abuse issues, according to E! News, and Khloé was trying to salvage their marriage.

All I'm saying is that this baby has been a long time coming and as a reluctant KUWTK fan myself, I'm secretly really excited for her. So in anticipation of the big day, here's a little timeline of some major Khloé pregnancy moments.

June: She Announces That She's Ready

E! Entertainment on YouTube

Really, this whole thing started back in June when, on the finale of KUWTK, Khloé goes to a fertility clinic with her sister. When the doctor hints that she might have some trouble getting pregnant, she officially goes off birth control to get her follicle count back up.

She said in her one-on-one regarding her relationship with Tristan, ""He wants to have like five or six kids with me. … Knowing I’m not on birth control, it’s scary. It’s like a really big step.” She concluded saying, “I am really excited about my future. Me and Tristan, we’re doing so well.”

September: The Rumors Start

In late September, only days after rumors broke that her sister Kylie was pregnant, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources said the 31-year-old star was pregnant. But the family stayed quiet.

October: She & Her Sister Troll Us All

Kylie Cosmetics on YouTube

While her family refused to comment on the rumors at all, fans scoured every gigabyte of social media for clues. Then, a video was released by Kylie Cosmetics featuring both sisters. Sure, it was an ad for the lip kits, but they also joked about ""having so many babies."" The suspense was real.

Then, The Couple Appears For Halloween

By Halloween, some people were planning on a pregnancy reveal for sure. Alas, it didn't happen. Instead, the couple posted tons of pictures of them dressed up as Game of Thrones characters — and nary a pregnancy bump to be found.

November: Her Sister Drinks Sardines

The Late Late Show with James Corden on YouTube

Remember how hyped up we all were for pregnancy news that Kim Kardashian actually drank a sardine smoothie just to not have to talk about her sister's uterus? We were wild, people. I'm sort of embarrassed for us. This was Nov. 15, and Khloé and Tristan ended up spending their Turkey Day in Cleveland, away from her family. And rumors abounded.

December: That Darn Christmas Card

For all of December the KarJenner fam had us refreshing our feeds for a pregnancy reveal in their gorgeous Christmas photo shoot. When Khloé did finally show up, in every shot she seemed to have baby Dream on her hip or lap or just didn't *seem* pregnant. And even though I scolded you, dear readers, to make assumptions about her body...I have to admit I was confused, too.

Dec. 20: The Big Reveal

Just when we were despairing that neither Khloé or Kylie was pregnant, the older sister stepped in and confirmed it all for us with a gorgeous Calvin Klein-inspired show of her bump. And it was a very merry holiday for everyone, as she went on to share her first bump pics.

January: Her 6 Month Mark

Just after spending New Year's Eve with Tristan, she shared a selfie on Jan. 2 announcing that she was officially six months pregnant, which means she'll likely give births sometime this spring, possibly late March or early April.

And really, that baby can't come soon enough. Hopefully she won't make us wait too long for that announcement, too.

273,"Kim Zolciak Biermann Rings in Her 40th Birthday in a Thong Bikini Kim Zolciak-Biermann is showing off her curves on her 40th birthday. The Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member took to Instagram during a ""short getaway"" to the beach to flaunt her toned body.

(Photo: Instagram / @kimzolciakbiermann)

In a photo taken by her husband, NFL free agent Kroy Biermenn, Zolciak-Biermann poses in a thong bikini, standing with her feet in the calm waters. In the foreground, a shirtless Biermann gives the camera a smug smile.

Her fans drooled over the photo in the comments section.

""Whatever you doing looks fabulous, and most of all it seems like the man you love, loves every second of it,"" someone wrote.

""Power couple,"" another gushed.

""Yasssss look at that booty!!!"" someone else wrote.

But some of Zolciak-Biermann's followers criticized the photo after Zolciak responded to a fan who asks how she gets a booty like that, with Zolciak-Biermann saying she ""runs 5 days a week."" Some wondered if instead she has had plastic surgery to thank for her curves.

""You run 5 days a week to your surgeon?"" someone wrote.

""Why are y'all acting like Kim didnt pay for that booty???!!! That's the answer! She's paid to 'adjust' most of her body parts, so stop acting like it's all natural!"" someone else said.

""Wonder what you’d look like if you aged naturally without the surgeries,"" one person asked. ""Still gorgeous though.""

But some defended the mom of six and said she should be able to go under the knife if she so chooses.

""Bought booty or not she still looks freaking amazing! She carried how many children!? She deserves a little nip and tuck! Haters!"" one person said.

Zolciak-Biermann is no stranger to controversy; the 40-year-old spent much of this season of Real Housewives of Atlanta embroiled in an ongoing feud with fellow cast member NeNe Leakes, who called her ""racist."" Zolciak-Biermann said earlier in the season that Leakes was “sick and disgusting” for living in a “roach nest."" This term, many of the women told Zolciak-Biermann at the RHOA reunion in April, appears to be racist for its cultural implications of impoverished black women living in the projects.

“You’re reaching. Reaching,” Zolciak-Biermann said in her defense. “Don’t try it. It has nothing to do with the projects or none of that s—. A roach is a roach.”

She claimed during the reunion episode that racism ""wasn't f— all that real"" — and then apologized after the episode aired for her words that she said were taken out of context.

She said: ""Racism is a sad reality in the United States. It has been prevalent throughout our country's history. Let me be very clear, I do NOT support, tolerate or put up with any form of racism, hate or other discrimination. My love for ALL people runs deep - I am open to all and always have been.""

She claimed that her remarks were part of a longer conversation with host Andy Cohen that didn't make the show.

""I was heartbroken when I watched the last few minutes of the episode and saw how my words were taken out of context. My comment that seemingly 'racism didn’t exist 10 years ago' was made as part of a larger, emotional 45-minute conversation about how, sadly, social media has become a hub for hate. Immediately following my confusing comment, I also said that 'it's not as real as it is now' referring to the power of social media. But those remarks didn’t make the show.""

But fans in the comment section didn't take her lengthy statement well, accusing her of a non-apology.

""Racism is real for us everyday,"" one user wrote. ""The threat is real for people of color. For you a white person to seemingly dismiss that threat, given the history of your people especially, it's beyond frustrating.""

""Sounds like she’s saying when racism was hidden then it didn’t exist,"" another added. ""Lol girl go kick rocks.""",1

The couple, who met on Season 5 of the hit MTV dating show, announced the birth of their son via a series of Instagram posts on Saturday. Gianna and Hayden named their son August.

“24 hours of labor ending with a c section… only for you, August,” Gianna wrote in the caption of an Instagram photo of her holding her new baby.

In his own Instagram post, Hayden discussed the difficulty Gianna had bringing August into the world.

“We were awake for 36 hours before you made mommy get a C section, but meeting you was still the single greatest moment of our lives, Little August,” Hayden captioned a picture of the newborn. “Mommy and daddy love you so much.”

Hayden and Gianna announced that Gianna was pregnant in February via an Instagram post. In the caption of a photo of Gianna holding the sonogram, she revealed that the pregnancy was not planned, but that they were thrilled to be parents.

“This came as a big surprise to us and am I nervous HELL YEA but I’m super super excited to grow this little bean into a cute lil mini me (or mini Hayden),” she wrote in the photo caption.

Last month, Gianna revealed that she and Hayden have not been living together during her pregnancy. She stated that the couple will be moving into a house together in Indiana this month.

“It’s been weird not living together but it’s worked out for the best,” she wrote on July 9. “It’s been so hard not being able to ‘nest’ and set things up but I’ve been working on my patience for 7 months lol I can do 2 more.”

August is the third to be born to an ‘AYTO’ couple. Season One’s Ethan and Amber Diamond welcomed a daughter in 2014. The couple’s second daughter, Serena, joined the family in June.

277,"Royal Style Rules Meghan Markle Broke on Her Royal Tour of Australia Last week, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry embarked on their first official royal tour together. The lovebirds — and parents-to-be — headed down under to Australia ahead of the 2018 Invictus Games. And, while they met with athletes, members of the community, and state officials, Meghan Markle wore some of her most stylish (and eco-friendly) looks to date. That said, many of Meghan’s outfits went against the strict royal style rules the queen has in place for official engagements.

Here are some of the royal style rules Meghan Markle broke while on the royal tour of Australia.

No spaghetti straps

While visiting Fraser Island, Meghan Markle stepped out in the ultimate vacation number: A lightweight, spaghetti strap Reformation dress. But, although we love the look, the queen probably didn’t approve of it. According to royal style rules, members of the family must dress modestly when on official family business. That means no spaghetti straps.

Meghan also wore a thin-strapped dress while visiting Bondi Beach earlier in the week.

No high slits

Speaking of dressing modestly, Meghan Markle’s Reformation dress also featured a very high, revealing slit. And, when she bent down to greet fans, her thigh was revealed. While it’s not the end of the world, the queen likely won’t approve of the look.

No casual clothes

The queen would prefer members of her family to avoid casual clothing while on an official engagement. However, this rule is often broken by her grandchildren (including Kate Middleton) — especially since they like to get involved in sporting events and activities. Meghan Markle was photographed in her most casual look to date while cheering on sailors in the Invictus Games.

No wedged-heels

Queen Elizabeth II reportedly hates wedged heels. So, Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle typically avoid wearing them around her majesty. However, while visiting Bondi Beach, Meghan Markle revealed her wedged espadrilles — a bit royal style rules no-no. That said, her sister-in-law regularly breaks this rule, as wedged heels are one of her favorite shoe styles.

Keep your outermost layer on

According to royal style rules, women in the family must keep their outermost layer (coats) on at all times. That’s why you always see Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, Camilla Parker Bowles, and the queen in a jacket — even if it’s warm out. That said, in a series of photos posted on Kensington Palace’s Instagram account, it appears as though Meghan Markle removed her jacket while enjoying a reception for the Invictus Games at Government House in Sydney. However, it is likely she showed up without a jacket and added it later as she got cold.

Meghan also appeared to remove the oversized plaid blazer she wore upon arrival to the Woodleys (a local farming family) in Dubbo earlier that week.

Hair must always be neat

The queen has a thing about unkempt hair. Which is why Kate Middleton often opts for hairnets to keep certain styles in place — especially in the rain. While in Dubbo, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex got caught in the rain (which made for some swoon-worthy pics of them!) and Meghan’s low ponytail appeared to take some of the hit. While it might not be a big deal to most (after all, it’s only hair), the queen would probably have preferred to see Meghan’s hair in a low bun, secured by a hairnet to keep things in place.

No low-cut necklines

In royal style rules, modesty is key. Which is why many royals avoid plunging necklines and showing too much skin. But, while visiting the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne on the royal tour of Australia, Meghan appeared in a v-neck dress. While it’s not the most revealing look of the trip — see: the dress she wore to Fraser Island — it is borderline against the queen’s style expectations.

Kate Garry Hudson (born April 19, 1979)[1] is an American actress, singer, author and fashion designer. She rose to prominence for her performance in the film Almost Famous (2000), for which she won a Golden Globe and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other films include How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), Bride Wars (2009), Nine (2009), and Deepwater Horizon (2016).

Hudson co-founded the fitness brand and membership program, Fabletics, operated by JustFab.[2][3] In 2016, Hudson released her first book, Pretty Happy: Healthy Ways to Love Your Body, and in 2017, she released her second book, Pretty Fun: Creating and Celebrating a Lifetime of Tradition.

Early life [ edit ]

Hudson was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actress Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, an actor, comedian, and musician.[1] Her parents divorced when she was 18 months old and she and her older brother, actor Oliver Hudson, were raised in Snowmass, Colorado, and Pacific Palisades, California, by her mother and her mother's longtime boyfriend, actor Kurt Russell.[4] Hudson's ancestry is Italian (from her paternal grandmother), Hungarian-Jewish (from her maternal grandmother),[5][6][7] and the remainder a mix of English and some German.[8][9] Hudson was raised Jewish,[10][11] and like her mother, she practices Buddhism.[12]

Hudson has stated that her biological father ""doesn't know me from a hole in the wall"", and she considers Russell her father.[13] Hudson has described her mother as ""the woman that I've learned the most from, and who I look up to, who has conducted her life in a way that I can look up to"".[14] She has four half-siblings: Emily and Zachary Hudson, from her biological father's later marriage to actress Cindy Williams; Lalania Hudson, from his relationship with another woman;[15] and Wyatt Russell, from her mother's relationship with Kurt Russell.

In 1997, she graduated from Crossroads, a college preparatory school in Santa Monica. She was accepted to New York University, but chose to pursue an acting career instead of an undergraduate degree.[4]

Career [ edit ]

Beginnings and Almost Famous (1996–2001) [ edit ]

At age 11, Hudson performed on stage at the Santa Monica Playhouse.[16] She made her film debut in the dramedy Desert Blue (1998), and subsequently appeared in the romantic comedy 200 Cigarettes (1999). She took on the roles of a college student in the psychological thriller Gossip, the lesbian daughter of the titular character in the dramedy Dr. T & the Women and that of a waitress in the romantic comedy About Adam, all of which were released throughout 2000.[16]

Her breakthrough came with the role of a veteran groupie in Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical dramedy Almost Famous (2000). She ""hung in and had turned down leads in other movies just to play the part"" and soon obtained it ""because of her loyalty"", according to Crowe.[16] For her performance, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[4] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, ""best-of"" list, saying, ""This power ballad of a movie also happens to be Crowe's greatest (and most personal) film thanks to the golden gods of Stillwater and their biggest fan, Kate Hudson's incomparable Penny Lane.""[17] She worked hard in avoiding association with her well-known parents, as she did not want to be perceived as someone who ""rode on somebody's coattails"".[4]

Commercial success (2002–2009) [ edit ]

In 2002, Hudson appeared in the remake of the historical romance The Four Feathers, as the fiancée of a young British officer (played by Heath Ledger). The film was panned by critics and had a lukewarm box office response.[18] In her next film, the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Hudson starred with Matthew McConaughey, as a writer for a women's magazine who starts dating a guy and eventually drives him away using only the ""classic mistakes women make"" in relationships. The film was a box office success, grossing over US$100 million upon its release. She also starred opposite Naomi Watts in the Merchant-Ivory film Le Divorce (2003), portraying a woman who, with her sister, dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of her former brother-in-law. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a ""C"" rating and wrote: ""I'm disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters"".[19]

Hudson in July 2006

Her next romantic comedies, Alex and Emma (2003), in which she played a stubborn stenographer, and Raising Helen (2004), taking on the role of a young woman who becomes the guardian of her deceased sister's children, were released to varying degrees of success. In 2005, Hudson starred in the supernatural thriller The Skeleton Key, as a young hospice nurse who acquires a job at a New Orleans plantation home, and becomes entangled in a supernatural mystery involving the house. In its review, The Washington Post, describing her, wrote: ""Hudson, who dials back her native, Goldie-given charm here to give Caroline a no-nonsense brusqueness, manages to convincingly convey a fearless bullheadedness rather than less sympathetic naivete"".[20] The film was a box office hit, grossing over US$91.9 million worldwide ($47.9 million in North America).[21] Her next film, the comedy You, Me and Dupree, in which she appeared with Owen Wilson and Matt Dillon as one half of a couple who allows an unemployed friend to move in, grossed US$21.5 million on its opening weekend of July 14, 2006.[22] It eventually made US$130.4 million worldwide.[23]

In 2007, Hudson directed the short film Cutlass, one of Glamour magazine's ""Reel Moments"" based on readers' personal essays, which starred Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Virginia Madsen, Chevy Chase and Kristen Stewart.[24] In the romantic comedy Fool's Gold (2008), her second film with Matthew McConaughey, Hudson took on the role a divorced woman who returns with her former husband while searching for a lost treasure. She was certified in scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef for the underwater scenes. The film made US$111.2 million worldwide.[25] In My Best Friend's Girl, another romantic comedy released in 2008, Hudson played the colleague of an amiable guy (Jason Biggs). Despite negative reviews, it was a moderate commercial success.[26]

Hudson starred in Bride Wars (2009),[27] alongside Anne Hathaway, playing two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day. The film was named among the 10 worst chick flicks of all time by Time in 2010,[28] but was successful financially, grossing US$114.6 million globally.[29] Her next film was the musical Nine, directed by Rob Marshall, in which she played a Vogue fashion journalist, alongside Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, and Judi Dench. The film was acclaimed by critics and Hudson garnered praise for her dancing skills, showcased in a 1960s-inspired original piece called ""Cinema Italiano"", which was written specifically for her character.[30]

Independent films and Glee (2010s) [ edit ]

Hudson starred with Casey Affleck and Jessica Alba, as the wife of a West Texas serial killer, in the film adaptation The Killer Inside Me, which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. In 2011, Hudson played a quickwitted, carefree ad executive in the romantic comedy A Little Bit of Heaven, and an unmarried attorney in another romantic comedy, Something Borrowed, based on Emily Giffin's novel of the same name. In is review for the latter, Detroit News remarked: ""Kate Hudson looks exhausted, as if she is as tired of wading through another one of her feckless duds as we are of watching them"".[31] While A Little Bit of Heaven found a limited release in theaters, Something Borrowed was a moderate commercial success.[32]

In 2012, Hudson was cast on the Fox teen comedy series Glee, in the recurring role of a dance teacher at the fictitious New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts.[33][34][35] In 2013, Hudson appeared in the political thriller The Reluctant Fundamentalist, as a photographer and the girlfriend of a professor at Lahore University.

The aforementioned films received a limited release and mixed reviews from critics.[36][37][38][39] In Rock the Kasbah (2015), Hudson played a top-hatted hooker with a heart of gold who befriends a has-been actor manager (Bill Murray) in Afghanistan. Despite a US$15 million budget, the film only made US$3 million at the North American box office.[40]

Hudson voiced a crazy ribbon-dancing panda in the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016),[41] which grossed US$521.1 million globally,[42] and became her most widely seen film.[41] She starred as a woman married to an Indian man and the sister of a lesbian woman, both of which had not told their conservative parents, in the romantic comedy Mother's Day (2016), directed by Garry Marshall and opposite Julia Roberts, Timothy Olyphant, and Jason Sudeikis.[43] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[44] She next played the wife of a chief electronics technician (Mark Wahlberg) in the drama Deepwater Horizon, based on the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45][46] While critical response was positive, the film made US$121.8 million, on a budget of around US$110 million.[47]

In the 2017 film Marshall, Hudson portrayed an employer accusing her black chauffeur of rape. It received positive reviews from critics but found a limited audience in theaters.[48] In 2019, she is set to star in Blood Moon, a fantasy-adventure film by writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour.[49]

Personal life [ edit ]

General [ edit ]

In early 2006, Hudson sued the British version of the National Enquirer after it reported she had an eating disorder, describing her as ""painfully thin"". Hudson said the tabloid's statements were ""a blatant lie"" and she was concerned about the impact the false report could have on impressionable young women.[56] The newspaper apologized and compensated her.[57]

Hudson says that she does not enjoy seeing herself on screen, saying, ""I get cold and I shake and I sweat"" when watching her performances for the first time.[14]

In 2016, Hudson said: ""Meditation has been the most helpful and life-changing thing for me. You can feel the difference when you meditate on a regular basis. At least I can.... I started practicing transcendental meditation a year and a half ago so I meditate 20 minutes in the morning and I try to do another 20 minutes in the afternoon.""[58]

Relationships [ edit ]

Hudson married Chris Robinson, the frontman for The Black Crowes, on December 31, 2000, in Aspen, Colorado.

279,"Royal wedding: Official photographer reveals secrets behind stunning pictures Chris Jackson looks for unexpected moments when taking photos of the royal family.

PRINCE Harry and Meghan Markle’s official wedding photographer has revealed he had just three minutes to shoot the “exhausted” couple.

Alexi Lubomirski, who also took the pair’s stunning official engagement photos, said the shot of Meghan entwined in Harry’s legs happened when the tired bride “slumped” on the groom.

The pictures have been called the most intimate royal wedding images ever seen.

Lubomirski told the BBC the shoot was “one of those magical moments”.

He said: “We went out there and had about three-and-a-half minutes to take some quick shots because everything was running like clockwork.

“It was just one of those magical moments when you’re a photographer and everything falls into place. I said ‘just before you go in, sit on those stairs.’

“And she just slumped between his legs and there was this moment where they were just laughing because they were exhausted and thinking finally it’s all over. It was one of these beautiful moments.”

Days after their dream ceremony, the couple got back to work, attending their first official event as a married couple.

A post shared by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on May 22, 2018 at 11:43am PDT

Meghan looked particularly regal at the garden party held at Buckingham Palace donning a peach dress from British brand Goat, a custom hat by Philip Treacy and nude pumps.

Goat is a brand often worn by the Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan’s new sister-in-law.

More than 6,000 charity workers were invited for the party, to celebrate Prince Charles’s 70th birthday, where they were treated to a speech from Harry, musical performances and a customary cup of tea.

The event was held ahead of Prince Charles’ actual birthday which is in November.

Meghan and Harry had delayed their honeymoon so they could attend the event.

The pair looked like they were enjoying their first week as husband and wife, with Meghan touching Harry’s back as they walked up the stairs of Buckingham Palace.

Hundreds of royal fans had lined the streets surrounding the palace in an attempt to get glimpse of the newlyweds.

Prince Harry was wearing a traditional morning suit with a yellow waistcoat and blue tie.

He gave a speech where he paid tribute to his father’s charity work.

“His enthusiasm and energy are truly infectious; it has certainly inspired William and I to get involved in issues we care passionately about and to do whatever we can to make a difference. In fact, many of the issues William and I now work on are subjects we were introduced to by our father growing up,” Harry said.

“So, Pa, while I know that you’ve asked that today not be about you, you must forgive me if I don’t listen to you — much like when I was younger — and instead, I ask everyone here to say a huge thank you to you, for your incredible work over nearly 50 years.”

The Prince, who was forced to bat off a rogue bee during the address, also asked the audience to take a minute to remember the one year anniversary of the Manchester terrorist attack.

281,"Grey's Anatomy Brought Back a Bunch of Familiar Faces for Last Night's Episode After more than 300 episodes, Grey's Anatomy still has the powerful ability to make me cry out like few other shows on television can. And last night I really didn't see it coming.

The main medical case featured a girl named Flora who needs intestinal surgery, performed by the titular Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). But Grey's being Grey's, the case of the week is never just about the medicine. Meredith has also been informed by Dr. Richard Weber that her estranged father, Thatcher, has leukemia and only weeks to live. Mer struggles with whether or not to contact her father throughout the episode. During the surgery, she tells her bestie Alex Karev, ""I don’t really need to grieve him because he’s been a ghost for years.” While the surgery goes off without a hitch, the whole concept of death and grieving is way more complicated, as much as Meredith wishes it wasn't.

It also happens to be Day of the Dead or Dia de los Muertos—the Mexican holiday that celebrates and honors loved ones who have passed away. Flora's family has a makeshift altar with photographs of family members who have died in her hospital room, which Meredith admires with the little girl's grandmother. When Mer says she's sorry for all her loss, the grandmother replies, ""Don't be. They are here with us now."" The grandmother then gives Mer a marigold for her hair, which she says helps guide our ancestors' spirits back to us. ""The veil between our world and the spirit world is very thin,"" she explains. ""The marigolds, the photos, the mementos, they help guide them to us.""

GREY'S ANATOMY - ""Flowers Grow Out of My Grave"" Ð Meredith has a patient whose family is celebrating Day of the Dead, making the doctors remember loved ones they have lost. Richard shares unexpected news with Meredith about her father, Thatcher. Meanwhile, Teddy tries to tell Owen that she is pregnant but they get sidetracked, and Jo encourages Link to pursue one of the doctors, on ""GreyÕs Anatomy,"" THURSDAY, NOV. 1 (8:00-9:01 p.m. EDT), on The ABC Television Network. (ABC/Mitch Haaseth)ELLEN POMPEO Mitch Haaseth

And just like that, the ghosts of Meredith's past are right there on our television screens once more as a Spanish-language version of Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" plays in the background. We see George O'Malley in his blue scrubs calling out to his old friend. Lexie Grey is behind the admin desk as Meredith says goodbye to a nurse. Her mother, Dr. Ellis Grey, watches her leave, as Doc the dog follows her down the hallway to…Derek, who says simply, ""Hey"" before Mark Sloane also appears beside him. Ahhhhh, McDreamy and McSteamy together again. I'm not crying—you're crying.

It was good to see them all again, but it also drives home how many important people Meredith has lost over the years. It's incredible that she's still a functional human. Showrunner Krista Vernoff talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the impetus for the episode's little twist. ""I loved the idea because after 15 seasons, it's exciting to be airing on a holiday we've never done an episode about—and because it's the holiday of the community that is being attacked in our country right now by our government and misrepresented,"" she said. ""The holiday is delightful. I had just seen Coco with my daughter—whose name is Coco—and the idea that our loved ones who died can come visit us on this one day of the year was moving. I suggested Meredith's dead people come back and visit her in this episode.""

I was not alone in feeling an emotional gut punch, as evidenced by reactions on social media.

She also reveals that an earlier cut of the episode featured Denny Duquette and Kyle Chandler's bomb squad character, but they didn't feel authentic and were cut. But don't expect to keep seeing those beloved faces regularly. ""This was a Day of the Dead, one-time-only thing,"" Vernoff tells THR. ""The holiday is about the dead visiting the living and the living inviting the dead to come for a visit. So it felt like the perfect opportunity to see the people Meredith has lost.""

When the episode ends, Meredith hasn't called her father…yet. It looks like she's heading in that direction, but as her voice-over notes, she's allowed to handle the situation however she wants. ""Every religion, every country, every culture, death means something different to all of us,"" she says. ""They all have different ideas about how to honor the dead. Different ideas of how to grieve. Different ways of moving on. Well, I may not be an expert but I do have some experience with losing people I love. And I say the right way to grieve is however the hell you want.""",1

So she must be insinuating Davidson should have kids with her.

Davidson seemed to like this notion, and commented with drooling emoji.

Kids these days ...

While their relationship is very new, we have to admit, Davidson and Grande would have cute babies.

284,"Why Did a Third S.N.L. Cast Member Silently Leave the Show Last Night? Last week news spread across trade publications that long-time S.N.L. cast members Bobby Moynihan and Vanessa Bayer would be leaving the show after this week’s finale. Don’t cry for Moynihan, he already has a new CBS sitcom lined up and with several recent appearances in big-budget comedy films, Bayer likely won’t go looking either. But with 16 years of S.N.L. work between them, Bayer and Moynihan seemed owed a splashy farewell from their comedy home. And that’s what they got—mostly. But what happened behind the scenes may be even more revealing. A third cast member, Sasheer Zamata, also left the show Saturday without so much of a whisper of goodbye on camera.

In this week’s S.N.L. finale hosted by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Moynihan and Bayer got much more than their usual amount of screentime with one or the other appearing in almost every single sketch. The pair also got a chance to trot out some scene-stealing characters for their last appearances on “Weekend Update” with Moynihan resurrecting Drunk Uncle one last time and Bayer deciding to go with a more recent character: her bubbly, incomprehensible meteorologist Dawn Lazarus. Their goodbye culminating in a not-very-steady high school graduating seniors sketch that paid homage to the departing class of 2017. However, any emotional impact this farewell may have had got a little lost in the weeds. So Moynihan and Bayer fans—knowing in advance the two were leaving—may have been expecting a more formal goodbye to come in the final seconds of the show as The Rock gave his thanks. Something akin to what Ben Affleck (with an assist from the camera operators) gave Bill Hader and Fred Armisen in 2013.

Compare that to the scene on the stage last night where the focus was on celebrity guest stars Scarlett Johansson, Katy Perry, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, and The Rock. That’s par for the course in a season that often placed a greater emphasis on celebrity impressions than highlighting the talents of its existing cast. Without rewinding, you’d be hard-pressed to even find Bayer and Moynihan (let alone Zamata) in the crowd.

But reports started circulating out of Studio 8H last night that Moynihan, Bayer, and Zamata all got a little more fanfare once the cameras stopped rolling. The effort started with Vanessa Bayer who was hoisted up and carried out by co-stars Alex Moffat and Beck Bennett.

Bobby Moynihan was then carried offstage by two all-time S.N.L. greats: Hanks and Baldwin.

But then why was Zamata also carried out by Colin Jost and The Rock?

Rumors about a third departure started circulating on social media Saturday night and by Sunday morning E.T. Online confirmed that Zamata would be exiting the show alongside Moynihan and Bayer. S.N.L. has never quite known what to do with Zamata’s particular skill set—which lends itself much better to longform showcases like her recent special, Pizza Mind—but she definitely deserved much more of a proper goodbye Saturday night than just playing the lead female in an ill-advised child molestation robot sketch.

Still, whatever you may think of Bayer, Moynihan, and Zamata’s last episode, they certainly got more fanfare than long-time cast members Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah who were unceremoniously let go in the middle of the summer last year. Killam had to make his own farewell video.

Still it’s hard not to see that S.N.L. has its favorite children. In 2002, the entire cast stopped to pay homage to Will Ferrell. When Andy Samberg and Kristen Wiig left the show in 2012, it was Wiig alone who got a massive, emotional farewell featuring Mick Jagger. (According to Lorne Michaels, Samberg and wasn’t quite sure about his departures at the time.) And in addition to their tearful farewells at the end of their episodes in 2013, Bill Hader and Fred Armisen each got goodbye sketches tailored to their particular tastes—a star-studded Stefon wedding for Hader and a musical-star-studded number for Armisen. And in 2014, a departing Seth Meyers was greeted by ghosts of “Weekend Update” past as he gave his final news report mid-season.",1

The Beauty and the Beast actress was protective of their relationship, avoiding talking about her business manager boyfriend in interviews.

In February this year she told Vanity Fair that she no longer takes photos with fans, in order to avoid giving out “tracking data” of where she is and what she’s wearing, and explained that keeping her private life under wraps is part of the way she deals with her worldwide fame.

“I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can’t have it both ways,” she said. “I’ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus.

It's true that the comedian racks up the LOLs whenever he's belting out hits with Adele, Ed Sheeran, Mariah Carey, Harry Styles and so many more in the comfort of his own car. The key is these sketches take place in his car.

288,"Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle: When royal wedding traditions fall 

Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh pose on their wedding day on Nov. 20, 1947.

Britain, 1947. The Second World War had ended but the nation’s struggle was far from over.

Rationing was still in place for myriad food items. In the streets, people queued for jobs, for handouts and for fresh fruit. Families torn apart by war tried desperately to rebuild, many without the men who had left home for battle and never returned. Access to fuel was limited. Then one of the coldest winters on record hit, destroying Britain’s wheat crop and leaving thousands of people in rural areas isolated.

When Princess Elizabeth’s engagement to Philip Mountbatten was announced that summer, many Brits welcomed the news. After so much suffering, the prospect of a royal wedding seemed to lift the nation’s spirit. “Oh, it gave us all a boost,” recalled Pat Bannell, a 97-year-old from East London. “We were all for it, especially if we got a day off work,” she said, chuckling.

The wedding of the future Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip came just four months after the engagement and was attended by 2,000 guests.

Across the country and around the world, people listened to the events unfold on the radio. Thousands gathered on the streets of London and outside Buckingham Palace, where they waited patiently for hours to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds after the nuptials. As the couple stepped out onto the balcony and waved, they were met with a roar of whistling, claps and cheers.

Describing the “vast crowds” and “shining happiness of the bride,” the Daily Telegraph reported the wedding would “live long in the memory.”

On Saturday, those long-ago newlyweds — the queen is now 92, Prince Philip is 96, and the couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in November — are expected to attend the royal wedding of their grandson Prince Harry to American actress Meghan Markle. (Prince Philip is recovering from a hip operation.)

[Britain’s black queen: Will Meghan Markle really be the first mixed-race royal?]

Planning any wedding is stressful — and mishaps are inevitable. Just ask Queen Elizabeth. On the morning of her wedding, the jewel-encrusted fringe tiara she was given as her “something borrowed” by her mother snapped as it was placed atop her head. The royal family, of course, had a jeweler on standby who was able to repair it and save the day.

Elizabeth’s wedding cake was nine-feet tall, and she received 10,000 telegrams of congratulations. The material for the wedding gown was purchased with ration coupons collected by the bride. Members of the public who wanted to help had sent their own coupons for the princess to use, although these were kindly returned to the senders.

Elizabeth’s dress was made from ivory silk and embellished with 10,000 pearls. But royal wedding dresses have not always been white. Before the 19th century, many royal brides opted for color, the bolder and brighter the better. When Queen Victoria wore a white ball gown to marry Prince Albert in 1840, she changed wedding traditions — royal and commoner — forever.

The demands of history always play a role in royal weddings. Not only do couples need consent from the queen to marry, they must also deal with an additional layer of pressure: to follow or jettison age-old traditions.

When the bride and groom exchange vows at Windsor Castle’s St. George’s Chapel this weekend, comparisons with the past will certainly be made. Kensington Palace announced this week that Markle’s father will not walk her down the aisle, as tradition demands. Instead she asked Prince Charles, her father-in-law, to perform the honor.

A statement from Ms. Meghan Markle: pic.twitter.com/TjBNarmuBU — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 17, 2018

Not having her father escort her isn’t without precedent. Queen Victoria was accompanied to the altar by her uncle. And Victoria walked her own daughter, Princess Beatrice, down the aisle in 1885.

On Saturday, smaller dramas will revolve around the royal couple’s decorative choices, sentimental touches and ceremonial decisions. All will be scrutinized. While many customs have prevailed throughout royal wedding history, others have been tweaked or replaced entirely.

The vows

When Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947, she took a traditional vow, promising to “love, cherish and obey” him.

It was Diana, Princess of Wales who broke with tradition in 1981 when she married Prince Charles by omitting the word obey. Diana instead promised to “love, comfort, honor and keep” her new husband.

Diana’s decision sparked controversy not just at home but also overseas. “LADY DIANA WON’T VOW TO OBEY CHARLES,” the New York Times wrote.

[Diana’s final hours: Dodi’s yacht, a Ritz suite, a diamond ring and relentless photographers]

Royal brides who came after Diana did not follow suit. When Sarah Ferguson married Prince Andrew in 1986, she vowed to obey, as did Sophie Rhys-Jones during her wedding to Prince Edward. (Bishop of Norwich Peter Nott, who led the wedding service, said use of the word ‘obey’ was about trust and did not mean Sophie was going to be “subservient.”)

In the run-up to Kate Middleton’s wedding to Prince William in 2011, speculation was rife about the impending vows. Would Kate do a Diana? The answer was yes. Standing in Westminster Abbey, she vowed to “love, comfort, honor and keep” her husband, with no mention of obeying him.

Now it is Meghan Markle’s turn to decide.

Flowers

When it comes to flowers and royal weddings, arrangements are traditionally all white — although size and style have varied dramatically over time.

Kate’s bouquet was described as simple by some and underwhelming by others. Diana’s bridal arrangement was quite the opposite, weighing in at more than four pounds. The bouquet was ostentatious, and she did not just have one, she had two. This is rumored to be because Elizabeth’s was allegedly misplaced by a footman and went missing at some point during her wedding day — much to the dismay of the official photographer. When it came time to take the family photo, her arrangement was nowhere to be seen.

Despite the differences in size, flower selection and personal preference, the inclusion of myrtle, which symbolizes love, is a tradition that dates back to the wedding of Queen Victoria’s daughter and is expected to continue with Meghan this weekend, although many anticipate she will add her own touch to the creation.

Wedding rings

At the time of her marriage to the future King George VI in 1923, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later known as the Queen Mother, opted for a wedding ring made from rare Welsh gold. From this date on, the Welsh wedding band became somewhat of a statement. Since then, the unique gold has been used to form the rings of the queen, Princess Margaret and Princess Diana. The wedding rings are formed from the same nugget, carefully extracted from the Clogau St. David’s gold mine in Wales. After his engagement, Prince William was given Welsh gold by the queen so Kate could wear a Welsh band.

Prince Harry recently said yellow gold is Meghan’s favorite, but it is not yet known whether her choice of wedding ring will follow royal tradition.

The date

Royal weddings often occur during the week, which, in the past has resulted in a day off for most workers. Queen Elizabeth and Philip were married on a Thursday. Prince Charles and Princess Diana on a Wednesday. Prince William and Catherine married on a Friday, and pubs and bars across the country had their opening hours extended to make room for extra drinking time.

Not only are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tying the knot on a Saturday, but it is also one of the biggest soccer matches of the year, the FA Cup final. For FA President Prince William, who is also Harry’s best man, it is shaping up to be quite the day.

Following a death, either accidental or deliberate, no matter how skilfully the responsible party covers it up, there remains the problem of disposing of the most obvious and most damning piece of evidence for the crime: the body itself. (There have been jurisdictions where no corpse means no murder.)

There are numerous popular methods for doing this:

A common way to indicate that a bad guy is not to be messed with is if they have an original and well-thought-through method in place to entirely obliterate a human body if needed. This indicates either that they're Crazy-Prepared, or that it's something they frequently find themselves having to do.

Pretty much any action movie with a significant body count won't even bother with this trope; the exception is if it's supposed to be taking place under The Masquerade, in which case The Men in Black may send in a Cleanup Crew to do the job.

292,"Kendra Wilkinson talks cheating on Hugh Hefner while living at Playboy mansion Kendra Wilkinson claims to still be good friends with Hugh Hefner, the man that not only let her live at his Playboy mansion for three years, but also made her a reality star with The Girls Next Door.

But it's hard to tell the blonde bombshell has any regard for the publishing mogul by the way she talks about their former romance.

When appearing on Kocktails With Khloe on Wednesday evening, the 30-year-old described how she went out of her way to step out on the publishing mogul, who will turn 90-years-old next month.

Ouch: Kendra Wilkinson told Khloe Kardashian during an episode of Kocktails With Khloe that she used to cheat on Hugh Hefner by checking into hotels down the street; here they are seen in 2006

Her old home: The blonde, now 30, moved into the Playboy mansion in Holmby Hills, California, when she was just 18-years-old

Dreamy: The E! star has said she moved into the mansion because it was nice, unlike the 'ugly' apartment she was living in

'I would go to hotels down the street,' said the mother of two, who is now married to former athlete Hank Baskett.

Pauly Shore was the guest who grilled the cover girl about her past (he had also asked Khloe about why she, Kim and Kris Jenner dated black men).

Wilkinson claimed she was not expected to be monogamous with the senior citizen, who she moved in with when she was just 18-years-old and he was 78-years-old. But she was expected to be quiet about it.

That is why she checked into hotels to sleep with other men.

The sit down: Pauly Shore was the guest who grilled the cover girl about her past (he had also asked Khloe about why she, Kim and Kris Jenner dated black men)

'I wasn't there for romantic reasons and for marital reasons like Holly [Madison] was,' said Wilkinson.

Kendra has been taking swipes at Holly ever since the beauty came out with her tell-all book about life at the Playboy mansion.

As far as romancing men inside the mansion, Kendra said she would not do that.

'I had respect by not going public with any of my relationships. I never hooked up with anyone in the mansion while being with Hef.'

The gals: Kendra, far right, with (from left) Holly Madison, Hugh and Bridget Marquardt in 2008

Wild child: The outspoken star has dished often about her time at the mansion; here she is seen during Heavyweight Fight at the Playboy Mansion - Tony The Tiger Thompson vs. Timor Ibragimov - in 2007

Her relationship with Hefner ended in 2008. She has since gone on to star on Kendra On Top.

As far as her sex life with Hefner, Kendra has said it was less than stellar.

'I was usually very drunk doing those evenings, I tended not to care about much until the next day. I had to be very drunk or smoke lots of weed to survive those nights,' she said in 2014 of getting into bed with Hefner when she was just a teen.

'At about the minute mark, I pulled away and it was done. It was like a job. Clock in, clock out. It’s not like I enjoyed having sex with him', the Daily Mirror reported.

Her family now: The reality star with Hank Baskett, Hank IV and Alijah Mary at Knott's Merry Farm Countdown to Christmas & Tree Lighting at Knott's Berry Farm in December 2015

She also said she moved into the mansion just for the location.

'He asked me to be one of his girlfriends and I was like, ""I don’t know what that means, but hell yeah I’m there.""

'I was living in the smallest apartment with the ugliest **** and I was praying for anything to get me out of there.'

She added: 'He asked me to be part of the Playboy Mansion and I accepted, of course. I went by straight away but I didn't know that sex was involved.

'He'd ask if you wanted to go upstairs, and that was that. I was 18 and he was 78.'",1

Tonya Harding threatened to walk out of an interview with Piers Morgan after the Good Morning Britain host implied that the former ice skater is using the film I, Tonya to “play the victim” and questioned her involvement with in the attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan.

On the show to discuss the movie starring Margot Robbie, Harding grew visibly frustrated as Morgan began implying that the film victimized her, rather than Kerrigan, whom Morgan believed was the true victim.

“Maybe it suits you to play the victim,” Morgan told Harding. “But I think the victim in all this wasn’t you. It was Nancy Kerrigan, who had her Olympic dream shattered.”

After taking a moment to respond, Harding then threatened to end the interview. “Thank you so much. I appreciate being on your show, but I think I’m going to have to say, ‘Have a good night.'""

Taken aback by her decision to cut the interview short, Morgan continued to press, “You’re going to end the interview, because I think that Nancy Kerrigan was the victim here and not you?”

“You weren’t letting me finish,” Harding argued. “I think that many people are the victims of abuse every single day and can’t stand up for themselves. People need to be able to understand that we need to stand united and that abuse should not be happening anymore.”

Tension continued to grow as Morgan began pressing Harding about her involvement with Kerrigan’s attack. “You did know, didn’t you? You did know what was happening?” Morgan asked, with Harding responding, “No I did not know anything prior. … No knowledge.”

Morgan then abruptly ended the interview soon after.

Harding’s biopic was recently nominated for three Golden Globes including best picture, comedy or musical. Although hesitant to be involved with the film, Harding told The Hollywood Reporter that she found Robbie's portrayal worthy. “I was so nervous to watch it, but when I saw it, I wasn't watching a movie about me. I was watching Margot, and then I went, 'Oh my goodness. That's about me,'"" Harding said.

Talk about it: Kim Kardashian admitted that her two children have a bit of a complicated relationship as North 'doesn't share' with her little brother Saint

Kardashian told the talk show host that North was 'better' with Chicago than she was with her brother, but things may be looking better for the kids.

North's change of heart was sudden as Kim said '…there was a shocking moment yesterday. She literally had a can of popcorn and was like, 'Saint, do you want some?' And I was like 'What!?'

'You gotta understand, she does not share with Saint , she does not hardly talk to Saint, so that was such a big moment in my household.'

She previously alluded to their rivalry back in October, saying 'Obviously North loves Saint, she just is still jealous.

'She needs to still get it together and warm up and like be a little bit nicer, but I think she is getting there. I saw glimmers of hope like a week ago. She’s not like harmful. She’s not like hurting him or anything.'

The mother-of-three gushed over her son in a tweet earlier this year, saying that the little guy is a genius.

'Guys I have to say my son is a genius! He’s two years old and knows how to spell gargantuan. Had to brag for a sec,' she shared on Twitter.

Kim also revealed to Ellen that she wanted to name her baby daughter Jo in tribute to her beloved grandmother, Mary-Jo Shannon.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star explained she wanted Chicago's name to be one syllable like daughter North, four, and son Saint, two, and so the moniker 'kind of messes' with her.

'We were gonna name her Jo because my grandma Mary Jo or we were gonna go with Grace and then it was Chicago,' she said.



'We were gonna name her Jo because my grandma Mary Jo or we were gonna go with Grace and then it was Chicago,' she said laughing

'Obviously because he's from Chicago but that is a place that made him,' the Kardashian said as she explained the reasoning behind her daughter's three syllable name

'But you told me you wanted a one syllable,' Ellen said in the teaser clip. 'When I was pitching names you said you wanted one syllable.'

'And I did,' Kim responded.

'So... Chicago is not one syllable.'

'Yeah, it kind of messes with me, I'm not gonna lie. I really like the one syllable thing,' Kim admitted.

Ellen went on to ask: Because Kanye wanted Chicago? Because he's from there?

In an interview with HYPEBEAST in 2013, the Life Of Pablo singer showed his pride for the Midwest and said, 'Someone from Chicago is very sincere. They don't give a f*** about what anybody is saying as long as its from their heart. That's what it means to be from Chicago or be from the Midwest.'

TMZ caught up Kanye's childhood friend Common at LAX following the West's baby name announcement.

'Kanye and Kim are family. He deserves to be able to name his child Chicago for as much as he does for our city and as much as he loves our city,' he told the media outlet. 'And that's a fresh name for a kid. I love it.'

Billed as “a global celebration of unity and love,” ABC’s Olympics-themed The Bachelor: Winter Games will reportedly feature a Nancy Kerrigan appearance, “winter-themed challenges,” plenty of snow, and roses — but not too much booze.

According to a source who spoke with E! News, ABC enforced new alcohol-consumption guidelines on the upcoming Bachelor spinoff, such as forbidding contestants from drinking immediately before competing in any challenges. (Not a bad idea!) ABC also reportedly implemented a two-drink-per-hour rule, required contestants to log all their drinks, and brought on mental-health and wellness staff members.

The alcohol crackdown is likely a response to last summer’s Bachelor in Paradise sexual-misconduct scandal, in which Corinne Olympios accused fellow contestant DeMario Jackson of sexually assaulting her when she was too intoxicated to consent. According to a Bachelor in Paradise crew member, Olympios “seemed to go limp” during their sexual encounter in a hot tub. (Warner Bros. later claimed there was no wrongdoing.)

While the new guidelines won’t stop contestants from getting at least a little drunk — most people would be if they had four drinks in two hours, which the rules allow — E! News’s insider said, “The producers took this really seriously.”",1

“Short hair is my favorite!! But I still need to lose a few more pounds and then I’ll cut it again,” she wrote on Twitter.

According to Khloé, she’s lost more than 30 pounds since giving birth to her daughter.",1

304,"Pregnant Cardi B Twerks at Coachella as Migos Seemingly Throws Shade at Nicki Minaj Twerkin’ mama!

Cardi B didn’t let her pregnancy slow her down one bit on Sunday as she took to the stage at Coachella. The 25-year-old rapper stepped out in a strapless white jumpsuit that showed off her growing baby bump, with cutouts down the legs.

Rocking pigtails and lots of bling, the ""Bodak Yellow"" artist danced, twerked and even pelvic thrusted onstage to the delight of concertgoers. The performance also featured cameos from Chance the Rapper, G-Easy, and Kehlani, who are also featured on Cardi's new album, Invasion of Privacy.

At one point during her provocative, twerk-filled performance, Cardi joked, ""That’s how I got pregnant.""

It's been a big week for the mom to be, whose album debuted at no. 1 on the Billboard 200 charts, making her the fifth female rapper ever to achieve this success.

Later in the evening, Cardi’s fiancé, Offset, performed with his group, Migos, and while he didn’t bring Cardi on stage as expected, fans noticed that when the trio performed their song, “Motorsport,” they rapped Cardi’s verse but left out Nicki Minaj’s lyric entirely.

The move was seen as Migos throwing slight shade at Minaj, who has publicly spoken out about her feud with Cardi.

The 35-year-old rapper claimed she was “hurt” by Cardi during an appearance on Zane Lowe’s Beats 1 show last week, and noted that due to scheduling conflicts, she was not able to make the music video shoot for the song, leading to some supposed drama between the women.

“I texted [hairstylist Tokyo Stylez], ‘You know if I don’t show up the day she's shooting, they’re gonna act like it’s because I’m doing it to be mean with the current Nicki hate train,'” she recalled. “They [Migos and Cardi] all knew that ... and still did interviews and jumped around it just to paint Nicki as the bad person, so you could play the victim. That really, really hurt me because I really, fully supported her.”

Minaj was also spotted at Coachella, partying with Shania Twain, Timothee Chalamet and more.

The 45-year-old actress shared a bright and breezy beachside snap on Friday, from her Cabo, Mexico bachelorette getaway.

In the photo, Paltrow shows off a huge smile and her bikini bod on the sun-bleached sand.

She captioned it simply: ""#costapalmas #henweekend,"" using the British term for a bachelorette party.

Among the friends rumored to be joining the entrepreneurial actress for the chilled out bachelorette are pals Cameron Diaz and Stella McCartney.

The mom-of-two has kept her engagement, to Glee producer Brad Falchuk, largely low-key since January when the couple publicly acknowledged it. They released a statement at that time saying, ""We feel incredibly lucky to have come together at this juncture in our lives when our collective successes and failures can serve as building blocks for a healthy and happy relationship.""

They have not announced a wedding date but Paltrow told ET in January that she'll probably ""dial it back,"" and not go for a big wedding.

“I think I'm [too] old to have a big wedding and a big ole white dress and all that,” she said at the time.

Paltrow famously ""consciously uncoupled"" from her first husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, in 2014 and their divorce was finalized in 2016. They have two children together, a 13-year-old daughter, Apple, and a 12-year-old son, Moses.

Jordan.

“Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry,” Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni, head of strategic outreach at Pearl Street Films tweeted in response to Jordan on Monday night. “On behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton, & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward.”

.@michaelb4jordan Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry. On behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward. https://t.co/ODit24D2Rb — Fanshen (@fanshen) March 13, 2018

Jordan, Affleck, and Damon have adopted inclusion riders following Frances McDormand’s best actress acceptance speech at the Oscars on March 4, where the Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri star closed her remarks by mentioning the term. An inclusion rider is a way for actors and actresses to guarantee projects they work on have a level of diversity, onscreen and off-camera, that matches the location setting of the project. Stacy L. Smith, the director of USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, first discussed the idea of an “equity rider” in a 2014 column for The Hollywood Reporter as a way to reverse Hollywood’s profound gender imbalance.

In a statement to Variety, Smith and Kalpana Kotagal, one of the lawyers working on the inclusion riders, said of the Pearl Street Films announcement, “It’s great to see Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and the Pearl Street Films team using their influence to create opportunities for people from underrepresented groups to enter the industry. The Inclusion Rider is an important tool for Hollywood, and other industries, to create workplaces that truly reflect our diverse world.”

Under their Pearl Street Films banner, Affleck and Damon have produced films such as Manchester By the Sea, Jason Bourne, and Live By Night, among other features and television series, and are currently working on Matt Reeves’ The Batman (with Affleck still set to star as the Caped Crusader) and Affleck’s remake of Witness for the Prosecution.",1

309,"Ocean's 8 2018 film by Gary Ross

Ocean's 8 (stylized onscreen as Ocean's Eight) is a 2018 American heist comedy film directed by Gary Ross and written by Ross and Olivia Milch. The film is both a continuation and a spin-off from Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy and features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, and Awkwafina. The film follows a group of women led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

After the release of Ocean's Thirteen in 2007, Soderbergh stated he had no intentions of making a fourth film, citing his desire to have the series ""go out on top"". However, an all-female spin-off was announced in October 2015, with much of the cast signing on by August 2016. Filming took place from October 2016 to March 2017 around New York City.

Ocean's 8 premiered at Alice Tully Hall on June 5, 2018, and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day of the release of Ocean's Thirteen. The film grossed $297 million worldwide and received a lukewarm response from critics, who applauded the chemistry of the cast but found the movie undemanding and less consistent than the films in Soderbergh's trilogy.

Plot [ edit ]

Newly paroled con artist Debbie Ocean – the ""late"" Danny Ocean's younger sister – convinces former partner-in-crime Lou to join her in a new heist. They assemble their team: bankrupt fashion designer Rose Weil; jewelry maker Amita, eager to move out of her mother's house; hacker Nine Ball; street hustler and pickpocket Constance; and profiteer Tammy, who fences stolen goods out of her suburban home.

Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, during the upcoming Met Gala and use movie star Daphne Kluger as a mule. The team manipulates Daphne into hiring Weil, and convince Cartier to loan Daphne the Toussaint. They digitally scan the necklace to manufacture a cubic zirconia duplicate. Tammy secures a job at Vogue and gains access to the gala, and Debbie leads Daphne to invite art dealer Claude Becker, whose betrayal sent Debbie to prison, as her date. Lou confronts Debbie for planning revenge against Becker, but Debbie reassures her this is not the case.

When Rose learns the Toussaint can only be unclasped by a special magnet carried by the bodyguards hired by Cartier, Nine Ball enlists her younger sister Veronica's help in defeating the mechanism. At the gala, Lou spikes Daphne's soup, causing her to vomit in the restroom, a blind spot to the Met's cameras created by Nine Ball. Constance removes the necklace and sneaks it to Amita, who splits it into smaller pieces of jewelry. The Toussaint's disappearance triggers the museum's evacuation, but the search ends when Tammy ""finds"" the duplicate necklace. Constance slips the Toussaint pieces to the team to smuggle out; Debbie plants a piece on Becker. After the heist, Debbie and Lou reveal Daphne had been in on the plan.

Cartier discovers the recovered necklace is a fake, and dispatches insurance investigator John Frazier. Having crossed paths with the Oceans before, Frazier immediately suspects Debbie, but her careful presence on the gala's video footage gives her an unbeatable alibi. She tells Frazier she may know who stole the necklace. Daphne visits Becker and sends Frazier a picture of the jewel Debbie planted. To further frame Becker, Debbie hires actresses posing as elderly socialites to sell the Toussaint pieces and deposit the money in Becker's name. Frazier takes Becker into custody.

As the eight celebrate their victory, Lou reveals the heist's true target: while the gala was being evacuated, she and ""The Amazing"" Yen replaced a Met display of royal jewels with replicas, escaping with gems even more valuable than the Toussaint. With a larger-than-expected share of the score, each member of the team goes her separate way: Amita travels to Paris with a man she meets on Tinder; Weil pays off her debts and opens her own store; Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a YouTuber; Tammy expands her business in stolen goods; Nine Ball opens a pool bar; Daphne becomes a film director; Lou goes on a cross-country road trip; and Debbie visits Danny's grave with a martini in his honor.

Cast [ edit ]

Additionally, Dakota Fanning appears as Penelope Stern, a celebrity who Kluger is jealous of, and Nathanya Alexander appears as Veronica, Nine Ball's younger sister.[4] Elliott Gould and Qin Shaobo reprise their roles from the previous films as Reuben Tishkoff and ""The Amazing"" Yen, respectively. Matt Damon and Carl Reiner were also set to reprise their respective characters Linus Caldwell and Saul Bloom, but their scenes were cut.[5][6] Marlo Thomas, Dana Ivey, Mary Louise Wilson and Elizabeth Ashley appear as elderly actresses who help the crew shift their stolen gems.[7] Celebrities who cameo as themselves in the film include Anna Wintour, Zayn Malik, Katie Holmes, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Kim Kardashian, Common, Adriana Lima, Desiigner, Kylie Jenner, Alexander Wang, Kendall Jenner, Ira Glass, Gigi Hadid, Lily Aldridge, Olivia Munn, Jaime King, Zac Posen, Hailey Baldwin, Derek Blasberg, Sofia Richie, Heidi Klum, Kelly Rohrbach, and Lauren Santo Domingo.[8][9]

Production [ edit ]

After the release of Ocean's Thirteen, Steven Soderbergh stated that there would not be an Ocean's Fourteen, noting that George Clooney wanted ""to go out strong"" with the third film.[10] In December 2008, Soderbergh again said that a fourth film in the franchise was unlikely, this time citing the recent death of Bernie Mac, who had appeared in the earlier films.[11] However, a female focused spin-off starring Sandra Bullock was in development as of October 2015.[12][13] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, and Elizabeth Banks were later announced to star in the film,[14] though Banks' presence turned out to be a rumor that did not materialize.[15]

In August 2016, Bullock, Blanchett, Bonham Carter and Kaling were confirmed to star, with Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Awkwafina, and Sarah Paulson closing deals to fill the cast.[16][17] During production on the film, Dakota Fanning and Damian Lewis were spotted on set, with Lewis's casting being confirmed in December 2016 and Fanning confirming her casting in March 2017. However, Lewis does not appear in the finished film.[18][19][20]

On November 11, 2016, Richard Robichaux was also cast in the film.[21] That same month, Matt Damon stated he would appear in the film, reprising his role from the Ocean's Trilogy;[22][23][24] however, his scene was not included in the finished film. In January 2017, James Corden joined the cast as an insurance broker who begins to grow suspicious of the group.[25] That same month, it was revealed Anna Wintour, Alexander Wang, Zac Posen, Derek Blasberg, Lauren Santo Domingo, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Katie Holmes, Olivia Munn, Hailey Baldwin and Zayn Malik were announced to cameo in the film.[26][27][28][29][30] That same month, Richard Armitage joined the cast of the film.[31]

Principal photography on the film began on October 25, 2016, in New York City.[32][33] In March 2017, Blanchett said production had officially been completed.[34]

On May 5, 2017, it was announced that filming would continue on Staten Island at the former Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, which Broadway Stages was in the process of acquiring after an initial rejection.[35]

Box office [ edit ]

After premiering at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on June 5, 2018,[36] Ocean's 8 was released by Warner Bros. to theaters in North America on June 8.[37][38] Ocean's 8 grossed $140.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $157.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $297.7 million, against a production budget of $70 million.[3]

In the United States and Canada, Ocean's 8 was released alongside Hotel Artemis and Hereditary, and was projected to gross around $45 million from 4,145 theaters in its opening weekend, although some tracking firms had it debuting with as low as $30 million. Deadline Hollywood noted that it was tracking on-par with the 2016 all-female Ghostbusters reboot (which opened to $46 million), and had more interest from audiences than the likes of fellow female-led comedies The Heat ($39.1 million debut), Spy ($29.1 million) and Girls Trip ($31.2 million).[39] The film made $4 million from Thursday night previews, including $100,000 from additional early screenings Wednesday night, and $15.8 million on its first day (including previews). It went on to debut to $41.6 million, 69% of its audience was female.[40][41] In its second weekend the film made $19 million, finishing second behind newcomer Incredibles 2.[42] In its third weekend the film earned $11.7 million, finishing third behind Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Incredibles 2.[43]

Overseas the film was released in 16 countries alongside the United States and made $12.2 million in its opening weekend. Its largest markets were Australia ($4.7 million), Mexico ($2.6 million) and Brazil ($1.7 million).[44] By its third week of release (where it made $26.9 million), the film had an international total of $70.9 million. Its largest markets were United Kingdom ($14 million), Australia ($13.6 million), Japan ($11.7 million), South Korea ($10.8 million), Germany ($7.4 million), Mexico ($6.3 million), and Brazil ($5.6 million).[45]

Home media [ edit ]

Ocean's 8 was first released on Digital HD on August 21, 2018.[46] Warner Bros. Home Entertainment then released the film on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD Combo Pack on September 11, 2018.[47] The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart for the week ending on September 15, 2018.[48]

Critical reception [ edit ]

According to several media outlets, Ocean's 8 received a generally lukewarm response from critics.[49] On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 323 reviews, and an average rating of 6.24/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Ocean's 8 isn't quite as smooth as its predecessors, but still has enough cast chemistry and flair to enjoyably lift the price of a ticket from filmgoers up for an undemanding caper.""[50] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on reviews from 50 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[51] According to BBC News, while critical reviews of the film were ""broadly positive"", ""most had some reservations"".[52] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by Ocean's Eleven and Thirteen.[40]

Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised the cast (namely Bullock, Blanchett and Hathaway), saying, ""Ocean's 8 is a heist caper that looks gorgeous, keeps the twists coming and bounces along on a comic rhythm that's impossible to resist. What more do you want in summer escapism?""[53] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap called the film ""slick, charming and funny,"" though added it never quite kicks into high gear"" and said, ""Cinematographer Eigil Bryld gives the proceedings the high-gloss of a SkyMall catalog, which is appropriate for a movie about robbing a legendary Cartier necklace at fashion's most exclusive event...And between the sheen and the talented performers, Ocean's 8 does eventually coast on froth and good will.""[54]

Variety's Owen Gleiberman said it is ""clever enough to get by"" and wrote ""Ocean's 8 is a casually winning heist movie, no more and no less, but like countless films devoted to the exploits of cool male criminals, it lingers most...as a proudly scurrilous gallery of role models."" He found Hathaway ""commanding at every moment"" and believed Bullock projected ""the debauched insolence"" and ideological drive of ""a hungry criminal"", but lamented the scarcity of impressive dialogue for Paulson and Blanchett, who ""don't get a chance to create indelible characters"".[55] In The Boston Globe, Ty Burr was more impressed by Blanchett's performance (""the Boss of This Movie"") and said, apart from Hathaway, the film largely depended on the ""established personas"" of the actors.[56]

Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said, ""Some movies are more about parallel play than actual playground interaction, and despite a screenful of terrifically skillful talents, Ocean's 8 never quite gets its ensemble act together. It's smooth, and far from inept. But it isn't much fun. That's all you want from a certain kind of heist picture, isn't it? Fun?""[57] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper said the cast ""banters beautifully, but the heist is a bit too breezy"", lacking a ""formidable, hiss-worthy villain"" and ""darker, more challenging, more nuanced adventure"".[58]

Response from actors [ edit ]

Kaling and Blanchett attributed the lukewarm reception to the dominance of male critics and a lack of diversity among mainstream film reviewers. In an interview with Yahoo! Movies, Kaling cited actress Meryl Streep's criticism of Rotten Tomatoes and said, ""There is obviously an audience out there who want to watch things like [Ocean's 8], what I work on, what Sarah [Paulson] works on ... I think white men, critics would enjoy [the movie], would enjoy my work, but often I think there is a critic who will damn it in a way because they don't understand it, because they come at it at a different point of view, and they're so powerful, Rotten Tomatoes.""[49]

Several film journalists strongly disagreed with claims that the reception had been dictated by the gender and ethnicity of the critics. Guy Lodge, a chief film critic for Variety, highlighted the fact that several female reviewers, including Emily Yoshida from Vulture and Time magazine's Stephanie Zacharek, concurred with the general lukewarm response.[49] Justin Chang, an Asian-American critic for the Los Angeles Times, argued that film criticism needed increased diversity, but ""We negate the possibility of sympathetic imagination when we assume that someone’s particular affinity for a work of art will be dictated in advance by specifics of race, gender and age."" He instead argued that the benefits would be a broader pool of talent and perspectives.[59] Donald Clarke from The Irish Times pointed out that film had received a ""fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a better score than Ocean's Twelve.[60]

Speaking of love, Joey Feek -- who has been living out her final days in hospice care after ending treatment for colorectal cancer in late October -- and her adoring husband, Rory Feek, were nominated for a GRAMMY for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for ""If I Needed You."" Monroe and Shelton were also up for the award.

Even though the country-bluegrass duo, who go by Joey + Rory, didn't take home the gramophone (it went to Little Big Town), like Shelton, Monroe was hoping they would.

""I wholeheartedly agree [with Blake],"" she said. ""Not only is it beautiful to watch how their story has unfolded and see where they're at right now, I would want nothing more than for them to win that. My fingers are crossed for them as well.""

311,"'DWTS' Alum James Hinchcliffe Engaged to Becky Dalton -- Here's How He Proposed! (Exclusive) Congrats are in order for James Hinchcliffe!

The 31-year-old IndyCar driver revealed via Instagram that he's engaged to his high school sweetheart, Becky Dalton.

Hinchcliffe posted a picture of the two, with Dalton showing off her stunning sparkler.

""Wait, what?! I thought they said 'til DEBT do us part'!"" he joked in the caption, adding their very fitting hashtag, ""#BeckyGetsHinched.""

Dalton, 29, posted the same snap, also captioning it with a silly message. ""Just got served a life sentence,"" she wrote.

The proposal happened on Monday, July 16, at Six Mile Lake in Muskoka, Ontario, ET has learned. Hinchliffe got the ring from Knar Jewellery in Oakville, Ontario. No one, save for his parents, Arlene and Jeremy, as well as the jewelers, knew the proposal was happening.

James Hinchcliffe and Becky Dalton

""Literally only four people in the world knew this was happening: my parents and the jewelers,"" Hinchcliffe tells ET of how he popped the question. ""After the Honda Indy Toronto, we headed to our cottage in Muskoka and I had it all planned out to ask her to go on a booze cruise after dinner. While we were driving up to the cottage, it was cloudy and not looking great out, but as we got closer the weather broke. After we made dinner, I ran over to my parents’ cottage telling Becky I was grabbing the boat keys, but really the ring was there, along with some champagne. I stashed them on the boat, and when we got to a place where we were just enjoying the moment, I got up and grabbed the ring from the glovebox. I got on one knee and asked Becky to marry me.""

James Hinchcliffe and Becky Dalton

""Somewhere amongst the ugly cries there was a yes and there you have it!"" he added. ""When we made our way back to the cottage, my parents had 'When a Man Loves a Woman' blasting with candles lit around our cottage.""

The bride-to-be tells ET that the proposal took her completely by shock.

“I was completely surprised! Honestly, I thought he was ruining our moment [enjoying the peace and quiet on the lake] because he got up and I thought he was going to start the boat back up,"" Dalton tells ET. ""He got on one knee and then I started ugly crying! He even hid a bottle of champagne on the boat along with the ring. I really had no idea.""

Last summer, Hinchcliffe stopped by ET's Los Angeles studio for a Facebook Live interview to reflect on his time on season 23 of Dancing With the Stars with his pro partner, Sharna Burgess. At one point during the chat, he couldn't help himself from gushing over Dalton, teasing that an engagement was ""on the horizon.""

""No immediate plans,"" Hinchcliffe said at the time. ""But you never know!""

Five-year-old Sophia Chiappalone, of Meriden, Connecticut, looks like any other little girl, but she has a serious health problem.

""She was born with half of a heart — the whole right side of her heart was missing,"" explained Kristy Chiappalone, Sophia’s mom.

She’s already had five times as many surgeries than she’s had birthday candles.

""She’s a walking miracle,"" Chiappalone said. ""There is no life expectancy at this time because there’s no reason for her to be alive.""

Now she’s in lung failure and needs another procedure. Sophia and her family will travel to Boston Children’s Medical Center to have the risky, open heart surgery.

But before that, she had a special wish.

""That’s all she wanted in the world, was to marry the love of her life,"" Chiappalone said.

That man is Hunter, her best friend from preschool. When Hunter’s mom Tracy found out, she knew she had to do something.

""I contacted my best friend who’s a photographer about maybe doing a mock bridal shoot and she was game,"" Tracy Laferriere said.

Sassy Mouth Photography did the shoot. Bliss Bridal shop in Cheshire donated Sophia’s gowns. With their help, the moms pulled off a beautiful wedding photo shoot.

""That was a happiness that I have not seen from Sophia in so long,"" Chiappalone said.

Sophia’s heart may not be healthy, but it’s clear, her heart is full of love.

""I hope that Sophia is going to live a long life and marry Hunter when she’s 25,"" Chiappalone said. ""But my hope for the future is that Sophia stays happy and healthy as long as her body can handle.""",1

315,"‘The resemblance is crazy!’: Louis Tomlinson fans gush over rare picture of son Freddie Louis Tomlinson fans can’t stop gushing over a picture of his son Freddie, saying he is a mini replica of his father.

Fans of the former One Direction singer went wild after Briana Jungwirth shared a rare picture of their 22-month-old on Instagram.

Jungwirth can be seen crouching down with her arms around the toddler who is smiling at the camera while standing on the pavement.

Fans were quick to point out the likeness between Freddie and his father, with many branding them the “spitting image” of each other.

One user commented: “He looks just like his father holy cow! The resemblance is crazy! It’s always neat to see who kids end up looking more like. So cute.”

Another posted: “He looks more and more like Louis every time I see him.”

A third wrote: “He takes after his father, he's like a little Louis.”

Tomlinson and Jungwirth welcomed their first child together in January 2016. He later rekindled his relationship with Eleanor Calder.

Tomlinson has been busy putting his debut solo album together and recently released his latest single Just Like You which he described as “very autobiographical and obviously about me.”

Speaking to Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio he said: “The fans have seen so much and got to know us so well, but I’ve never really had a chance to be as honest like that with music, so that was really refreshing.”

He continued: “It felt good to have a real advert there that was 100 per cent me. The important thing to me was that, I’ve read a lot of press stories about myself and the press and everyone naturally puts this spin on fame and celebrity, and I kind of just wanted to show the other side of it.”

Tomlinson said he has “always kind of struggled with the concept of fame” and that it was “important to me to write a song that could humanise me as much as possible and that the fans can really feel I’m just like them.”",1

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tonya Wise/Invision/AP Tonya Wise/Invision/AP

Television's most famous amphibian is set to get a new voice.

Steve Whitmire, the puppeteer who for 27 years has performed as Kermit the Frog, is no longer voicing the green lead of the various Muppets TV programs and films, a spokesperson for The Muppets Studio confirmed to NPR. He will be replaced by longtime show veteran Matt Vogel.

The spokesperson did not immediately comment on the reason for the switch.

Whitmire, who first joined the Muppets in 1978, had served as the man behind the frog since the death of show creator Jim Henson in 1990. And as NPR's Rose Friedman notes, Whitmire wasn't just a one-Muppet man: He has also played Bert's best pal Ernie, Rizzo the Rat and Beaker, among other characters.

That said, Vogel has plenty of experience as well. He has voiced Sergeant Floyd Pepper, and The Associated Press notes that during his career he has also stepped into the roles of Big Bird and Count von Count.",1

There was good and bad this year, as always, but we have to admit this time around we were pleasantly surprised by just how great the convention was.

We’re all still recovering from the exhausting convention, so forgive our uneven distribution of “winners” and “losers” among the staff—we don’t all fall in either “fangasm” or “grumpy Gus” territory. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Without further ado, here are io9's winners and losers of Comic-Con 2018.

The Clone Wars Is Saved!

There was no greater surprise this year at Comic-Con than the announcement that was made at the 10th anniversary panel for the beloved Clone Wars animated series. Fans had long accepted the series as having come to a close, even if it didn’t quite get to end the way Lucasfilm Animation had planned it to. And yet, there were no leaks, no real solid rumors that it was even possible the show could get one last hurrah—after all, Rebels only just ended earlier this year, and Resistance is on the way. So to see a trailer announcing 12 brand new episodes of the series, building on ideas the Clone Wars crew have been teasing for years at this point, was simply mindblowing. Ahsoka Tano was right: It has been awhile, but it was worth the wait to get this incredible news. —James Whitbrook

Iron Fist Looks...Good?

Despite the fact that he’s the titular hero of the series, Danny Rand was one of the most disappointing parts of Iron Fist’s first season for a number of different reasons, one of the most egregious being that you could clearly tell actor Finn Jones really hadn’t committed himself to learning his fight choreography. With the first season still clearly in everyone’s minds, the anticipation during the show’s panel at this year’s San Diego Comic-Con wasn’t exactly high, but as Marvel’s head of television Jeph Loeb gave the audience a look at a number of scenes from Iron Fist’s second season, it became immediately clear that Jones got it together. Not only are Danny’s fights going to be slicker, more technically complicated, and gorgeous to watch, everyone who’s coming back this season is working on a higher level that’s going to make the next chapter of the Iron Fist saga something to legitimately get hyped about. —Charles Pulliam-Moore

Doctor Who’s Jodie Whittaker Had a Blast

Doctor Who fans were already quivering with excitement that the show’s Comic-Con presence would give us our first-ever glimpse of the next season, and a chance to see the show’s first female Doctor strut her stuff. But beyond that stunning trailer, Comic-Con 2018 was also the first major chance for Whittaker to interact with Who fandom at large, and she grabbed that chance with both hands. From the fun video heralding her arrival at the panel, to surprising audiences at the Her Universe Fashion Show, to meeting the cutest little cosplayers and kicking ass at Entertainment Weekly’s annual all-women panel celebrating female heroes, it was clear: The Doctor was in, and we loved her. —James

Castle Rock’s Introduction to Stephen King’s Amalgam Universe

Hollywood has long had a deep love for Stephen King, but the hunger for adaptations of the horror author’s works has escalated mightily thanks to the blockbuster success of It. Hulu series Castle Rock has an offbeat premise that sets it apart from the rest: it tells an original story inspired by King’s favorite fictional small town, a place where the top employer is Shawshank prison and nearly every household’s hiding a few grisly secrets. Diehard King fans will enjoy the Easter eggs that weave into the narrative, but anyone who digs slow-burn, creepy psychological horror will want to tune into the show, which had its world-premiere screening at Comic-Con. —Cheryl Eddy



Star Trek: Discovery Loosens Up

The first season of Star Trek: Discovery could get a little too grim and self-serious for its own good, but what we saw of the show’s second season at Comic-Con gave us a lot of hope that the bright optimism of Star Trek would shine strongly for the Discovery’s sophomore outing. Questionable use of Lenny Kravitz aside, the trailer was filled with fun humor and a grand sense of adventure and exploration—especially thanks to Anson Mount’s arrival as the pre-Kirk Captain of the Enterprise, Christopher Pike, who seems to be having the time of his life both in front of and behind the Trek cameras. —James

Jamie Lee Curtis at the Halloween Panel

Anyone who has attended a Comic-Con panel knows that the portion of the event that’s set aside for audience questions is usually pretty forgettable, if not downright excruciating. That was not the case at the Halloween panel, where one fan stepped up to the Hall H mic and shared an incredible, deeply personal story about how he survived a very scary situation by drawing inspiration from Jamie Lee Curtis’ character in the horror classic. The man (who was wearing a “Haddonfield High” t-shirt) received a standing ovation from the audience, and Curtis herself got up from the stage to give him a hug. It was one of Comic-Con’s emotional high points, not just this year but any year. —Cheryl

Supergirl’s Historic Announcement

Supergirl’s upcoming fourth season will focus on how the world begins to accept racist anti-alien sentiment in the wake of a devastating invasion that pushes Supergirl to her limits. While that story is particularly timely given our political climate, the show is also making a powerful statement about the importance of on-screen representation with the introduction of Nia Nil, a reimagined version of the Legion of Superheroes character Dream Girl, who next season will be a transgender reporter played by transgender actress and activist Nicole Maines. While the fact that Nia is trans might not play a huge role in her character’s arc this season, her introduction in the show is momentous because she’ll be the first transgender superhero on network television. Not only that, but Supergirl just single-handedly proved something we should all know to be true: It’s not at all hard to actually cast transgender people to play transgender characters. —Charles

People Outside of the Convention Center

There were thousands and thousands of fans crammed into the San Diego Convention Center every day of Comic-Con, taking in panels and roaming the main floor, but some of the most fun and creative activities were actually the off-site pop-up events. While everything in and around Comic-Con requires waiting in line, this year it was actually worth it for those who ventured out to eat at Taco Bell’s Demolition Man restaurant, shop for supplies at the Purge City Emporium, totally immerse themselves in the DC Universe’s new streaming shows, or join a group therapy session to work through their lingering grief over the end of Avengers: Infinity War. Sure, it’s all marketing, but when it’s this clever, fun, and/or tasty, we can’t really complain. —Cheryl

Amazing Animation

Even though there were a number of epic trailers for live-action movies that got everyone excited during this year’s Comic-Con, the animation presentations held their own and really demonstrated just how much more bold and imaginative the medium is in general right now. Nickelodeon’s upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show is getting back to the original series’ more mystical roots while also reimagining the iconic characters in a dynamic way that makes them feel fresh and fun. Voltron’s giving the fandom the representation it craves by introducing Shiro’s boyfriend Adam and teasing that a new Lion might be in the works that would completely transform the Legendary Defender. As impressive as the lines for Hall H were, the energy in the Steven Universe line was palpable—and the show’s panel delivered tens across the board with a surprise presentation of the newest episode “Legs From Here to Homeworld” and the announcement of a forthcoming movie that’ll see the Crystal Gems facing a new foe. Hell, Invader Zim’s coming back, Disenchantment actually looks kinda good, and The Dragon Prince is definitely a series to look out for. We’re living in a golden age of television and a lot of it in the near future is going to be animated. —Charles

Warner Bros.’ DC Movies Seize the Moment

At a Comic-Con with no major Marvel Studios presence, Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment had an opportunity they couldn’t afford to squander—a great chance to get fans really hyped for their next few movies. They didn’t just take the chance, they reveled in it, delivering a disarmingly charming first look at Shazam! (which looks like a lovingly goofy movie that strikes at the heart of the DC movieverse’s “grimdark” reputation) and an epic pulpy trailer for Aquaman, bright and bold and jam-packed with underwater action. If that wasn’t enough, fans in attendance got to bring the house down for an extremely early glimpse of the still-weeks-into-filming Wonder Woman 1984, and it sounds like was an absolute blast. DC came out of Comic-Con like royalty, and it deserved to. —James

Kevin Smith Pays Tribute to Jon Schnepp

Not all news at Comic-Con this year was happy—Wednesday brought word that writer-director Jon Schnepp, the architect behind The Death of Superman Lives and Metalpocalypse, tragically passed away after suffering a stroke. Schnepp’s legacy in pop culture criticism was honored by Kevin Smith at his Hall H panel on Sunday, a fitting tribute to a writer and director beloved by many. —James

Hashtag Hall H Problems

Hall H was a bit of a mess this year. Thousands of fans waited for hours, or even overnight, in order to get a coveted spot at San Diego Comic-Con’s main showcase room. But in some cases, they might not have needed to. There were reports that the hall had tons of empty seats and people were just walking in at different times of the day. Of course, that wasn’t always happening, even at times when it should. Fans shared that sometimes they were kept out of Hall H—even when dozens of seats were still empty inside! And that’s not even getting into the problems with people holding spots in line for their friends, or line cutters who weren’t stopped by security. —Beth Elderkin

The Fantastic Beasts panel



While the new trailer for Fantastic Beasts sequel The Crimes of Grindelwald was magical on its own, Warner Bros.’ decision to bring controversial star Johnny Depp onstage— in character as evil wizard Grindewald—was not. It was a surprise, sure, but not the nice kind of surprise, since nobody in the audience (especially those that were heard booing the actor) was about to forget who was under that wig and make-up. Plus, there was the added uncomfortable subtext that the panel for Aquaman (which included Amber Heard, Depp’s ex-wife) was the next to take the stage. —Cheryl

That Bozo Who Asked Amber Heard to Untie Him

After the uncomfortable situation that was having Heard appear on stage right after Fantastic Beasts, an audience member dressed in bondage gear had the gall to tell Heard during a Q&A that he needed her help to get out of his fetish outfit. Behavior like this is sadly more common than it should be—and by that, I mean it should never happen at all. Don’t be the person who tries to coerce a celebrity (or really anyone at conventions) into participating in your sex stuff without their enthusiastic consent. Never be that person. —Beth

Sony, For Sharing Almost Nothing

Nobody could have predicted the James Gunn news (the timing of which meant the fired Guardians of the Galaxy director did not appear as part of Sony Pictures’ showcase panel as planned). But even beyond that, Sony was a pretty big disappointment. The studio’s current projects have enormous fan interest, especially Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Venom, and those few thousand who were lucky enough to score a seat in Hall H got glimpses of both. If you were watching from afar, however, you had to content yourself with breathless descriptions of the footage, which still has yet to be shared online. —Cheryl

Marvel Movie Fans

As we mentioned, San Diego Comic-Con 2018 was a great year for DC, but fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe were treated to a whole heap of nothing. No trailers, no announcements, not even any surprise appearances. It was a ghost con. Marvel announced earlier this year that it wouldn’t be appearing at this year’s con, and I mean, it makes sense—Captain Marvel only recently finished filming, and any question about the Infinity War sequel would have to be met with stony awkward silence. However, it did mean that one of the two largest comic book film franchises in the galaxy was nowhere to be found at the greatest fan event of the year. —Beth

Advertisement

Jeph Loeb

Speaking of Marvel, executive Jeph Loeb moderated a number of the studio’s panels at this year’s Comic-Con, and while the panelists themselves all did excellent jobs at representing their respective shows, Loeb himself made a number of inappropriate gaffes at different panels that were insensitive in a way that made one wonder if he was actively trying to be offensive. Even though the next season of Iron Fist looks better than the first, it’s still really disappointing that Netflix decided to cast Danny Rand as a white guy but hey, there’s no changing that at this point. That being said, there was absolutely no reason for Loeb to moderate the panel wearing gi and making jokes about Mr. Miyagi. What’s more, kicking off the Cloak & Dagger panel by asking the audience to split into gender groups in order to chant is...just weird, especially when you go on to misgender a fan during the Q&A portion of a panel. It’s obvious that Loeb likes being up on stage and so long as Marvel’s shows come to conventions, it’s likely that he’ll be the one to introduce them to fans—but in the future, it’d probably be best if he kept his “jokes” to himself. —Charles

The Buffy Reboot Non-Announcement

The possibility of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show reboot has been talked about for months. Years, even. While fans might be divided on whether or not we need a reboot of a reboot—I personally don’t see a point, given how the show works best within the context of its time—there’s no doubt that it could be one of the most-talked-about reboots of the past decade. With that said, the announcement was a ridiculous blunder. It was teased in a story from The Hollywood Reporter during San Diego Comic-Con, but nothing was announced at San Diego Comic-Con. And creator Joss Whedon was at the con this year, appearing on the Dr. Horrible panel, so why didn’t he have something prepared? One can only speculate—I personally think it’s possible the reboot team is not super confident fans are going to respond well. But no matter the cause, it definitely left a mark that might be hard for the new show to brush off. —Beth

Titans’ Gritty Arrival

Considering how much flack Warner Bros. gets for how gritty its big-screen adaptations of DC Comics’ heroes have been, we weren’t expecting Titans—based around characters made extra popular by a fun animated children’s show—to go that route. But go it did, and hugely so, in its first trailer. I never expected Dick Grayson to say the words “Fuck Batman” but well, now I’ll never un-hear them. We have to admit, where we were once excited by the show anchoring WB’s original content on its DC Universe streaming service (which is shaping up better than expected!), we’re now super hesitant. At least we’re still very excited about the Teen Titans Go! movie making fun of the DC film universe.—Jill Pantozzi",1

Vicki shared that Briana had decided to move back to the OC in November 2015, but Ryan remained in Oklahoma while awaiting his medical retirement from the Marine Corps.

Vicki revealed to The Daily Dish in July that she and her family were getting ready to welcome Ryan back home to California permanently, which was fortunate for Briana since she had ""really been missing her husband,"" according to Vicki, and a blessing for the family's matriarch, too.

This year’s theme for the fundraising event in New York was “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination”.

It was selected to pay tribute to the masterworks of religious art in the museum through the medium of fashion.

Naturally, when you’ve got celebrities dressing as the Pope (we’re looking at you, Rihanna) and sporting a fake tan that President Trump would be proud of, the memes came thick and fast.

Beyonce sparked a media storm when she announced she’d be giving the event a miss - four years after that moment when her sister Solange attacked her husband Jay-Z in a lift.

But one cheeky Twitter user suggested she had made an appearance after all - as the Holy Ghost.

Meanwhile RiRi’s “Pope” attire had many fans aspiring to convert to Catholicism.

Kim Kardashian put her killer curves on display in a striking gold Versace gown as she attended without husband Kanye West for the second year in a row.

Though one Twitter user compared her “heavenly body” to a bejewelled golden chalice.

Another mocked model Cindy Crawford for appearing to pay little homage to the theme - other than the “Heavenly Body” part.

And one pointed out actress Frances McDormand’s headpiece looked like she was promoting her new film: “Free Bluebirds Outside A-Big Museum”.

Pregnant American rapper Cardi B got a bit of stick for her elaborate head crown, which one person likened to the Starbucks logo.

Another suggested her look was a budget version of Beyonce’s striking gold Grammys 2017 outfit which showed off her growing baby bump.

They posted contrasting snaps of the two singers, writing: “When you order something online vs when it arrives.”

Another Twitter user made the same joke about Zendaya’s and Shailene Woodley’s Joan of Arc costumes.

325,"Chris Soules Was Seen In Public For The First Time Since The Hit-And-Run Arrest Chris Soules hasn’t been seen since his arrest after leaving the scene of a fatal crash back in April and his court appearance on April 25. The former Bachelor star has come out of his hiding place oddly enough to stop at an O’Reilly’s Auto Parts in Iowa this Wednesday.

Soules was pretty friendly with the press, and we really seemed in a good mood at the moment. He chatted with some customers and employees during his errand.

There was one very excited employee who told the 35-year-old that she always wanted to meet him and she also asked him to pose a photo which he did.

Earlier this week, he pleaded not guilty for leaving the scene of the accident in April.

The auto parts employee posted a photo on her Instagram account saying that he was her sweet customer from that day.

Despite all the nasty things that have been going on with the star, he was all smiles posing for the picture for the O’Reilley’s employee.

She received some backlash for her Instagram post and then she posted an emotional message on her Facebook account for the whole world to see as she was asking for compassion and love.

“This is a kind-hearted man. He is a farmer. I was able to let him know that I pray for him and that meant a lot to me. I just wanted to tell him that and I got the opportunity finally.”

Soules is having some serious trouble since he was involved in that particular fatal accident that killed the 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher in Buchanan County, Iowa.

After the crash, Soules was arrested at his home which is a few miles away, and he was charged because of leaving the scene of a fatal accident.

This is a Class D felony in Iowa that could lead to a five-year jail sentence.

His lawyers said in a statement last month that Soules was the one that contacted the police and, “during the call, he clearly identified himself and explained his role in the terrible accident. Soules attempted to resuscitate Mr. Mosher and remained on the scene with him until emergency medical personnel arrived.”",1

It’s no secret that the actor has found huge success in and out of Hollywood after starring in Dawson’s Creek, Mercy and more hit projects. But what some fans may not know is that the proud dad and husband is also dyslexic.

James decided to partner with The Child Mind Institute‘s #MyYoungerSelf campaign to end the stigma of mental health and learning disorders. In the process, he may have inspired a whole lot of fans with his personal story.

“You’d think that words wouldn’t really be my thing and yet, they are. I have committed an entire career to writing them, to reading them out loud in front of people to memorizing them and reciting them back in front of many other people and if I could say one thing to my younger self, it would be have fun with it,” he shared in a new video obtained by E!

327,"Cardi B Is Not Pregnant And She Responded To The Rumours In The Best Way So, if you haven't heard, the break-through artist, Cardi B is allegedly pregnant. The ""Bodak Yellow"" singer didn't officially announce her pregnancy, but news outlets everywhere are buzzing with the news that she is currently with child.

The event that sparked all of this baby belly talk begins with the Maxim party. TMZ reports that at the event, there were two VIP areas reserved for talent and football players, and another area reserved for Cardi B and her entourage. Cardi B quickly left the area explaining that she ""didn't want to be in a party atmosphere"". That's when pregnancy rumours began flying.

@iamcardibembedded via

If you ask me, that's not enough reason to believe that someone is pregnant. Supposedly one of her reps told a staff member at the event that she was 3-4 months pregnant.

After stories started to swirl, Instagram followers began assuming she was pregnant after seeing her recent photos. Once Cardi caught wind of her supposed pregnancy, she became irritated, to say the least.

In typical Cardi B fashion, she took to social media to let everybody know what's up. She responded to the rumours by saying ""No bitch I'm just getting fat. Let me fat in peace."" You have to admit, even when she's firing back at haters, Cardi B is absolutely hilarious.",1
328,"Bill Cosby to Teach Young People How to Avoid Sexual Assault Charges UPDATE: Despite Cosby’s own rep telling Rolling Stone and other media outlets that Bill Cosby’s upcoming town halls would center around sexual assault, a second rep for the comedian has backtracked and said the meetings will focus on “restoration of [Cosby’s] legacy.”

***

Less than one week after a judge declared Bill Cosby’s sexual assault case a mistrial, the embattled actor-comedian is gearing up to “get back to work.”

On Thursday, Cosby’s rep, Andrew Wyatt, told Good Day Alabama host Janice Rogers that the actor is planning to hold a series of town hall meetings starting “sometime in July” to help educate young men and women about sexual violence – specifically, the threat of being accused of inappropriate behavior.

“This is bigger than Bill Cosby,” Wyatt said on the show. “This issue can affect any young person, especially young athletes, of today, and they need to know what they’re facing when they’re hanging out and partying, when they’re doing certain things they shouldn’t be doing. And it also affects married men.”

Wyatt’s reference to married men is a nod to the primary argument made by Cosby’s defense attorney Brian McMonagle, that Cosby was a man who had been unfaithful to his wife, but not a perpetrator of sexual assault, as accuser Andrea Constand had testified. Added Ebonee Benson, a spokeswoman for Camille Cosby, “Laws are changing, the statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault are being extended, so this is why people need to be educated on … a brush against the shoulder. Anything at this point can be considered sexual assault. It’s a good thing to be educated about the laws.”

When reached for comment, Wyatt issued a statement to Rolling Stone confirming the town halls – and suggesting that he’s hoping they will expose the larger forces at play in Cosby’s trial.

“My Associate Ebonee Benson and I received hundreds of calls from civic organizations and churches requesting for Mr. Cosby to speak to young men and women about the judicial system,” Wyatt tells Rolling Stone. “They feel that the young men and women need to be aware that Mr. Cosby was given a deal to never be criminally charged by Former DA Bruce Castor and 12 years later DA Kevin Steele runs a Willie Horton style campaign ad saying, ‘If you elect me I will bring Bill Cosby to justice.'”

“These groups would like for Mr. Cosby to share that people in the judicial system can use their powers to annul deals for personal agenda and political ambitions,” he adds. “Speeches will be free.”

“People can educate themselves on the situation that they’re facing today,” Wyatt tells Rolling Stone of the planned events. “Laws are changing. Statute of limitations are being amended. It’s important to educate people that you could be at a baseball game and it could be crowded and a young man could try to squeeze through and accidentally touch a young lady’s butt or breast by mistake and that could be considered sexual assault. It’s imperative that we educate people that want to be educated.”

Following the mistrial ruling, Steele announced he would retry Cosby within 120 days. While Wyatt admits that “our legal team will be going through everything he’s going to say,” he claims his team will not vet audience questions ahead of time, ostensibly allowing both supporters and detractors from questioning the comedian. “I don’t think he’s going to say anything to jeopardize the [upcoming] trial or put himself in harm’s way,” Wyatt says. “There are going to be some questions he won’t be able to answer.”

The genesis of the planned town halls, says Wyatt, came from requests from various church and civic organizations, though he declined to provide any specific groups.

On Wednesday, an anonymous juror told ABC News that the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation because of two jurors who believed Cosby should be acquitted. “There was no budging,” after the first deadlock, the juror said, “and there was none from there on out.”

A second juror spoke to The Associated Press Thursday, saying that the jury was actually more evenly split with a similar number of jurors wanting to convict Cosby as wanted to acquit him.

The second juror told the AP it was suspicious that the three charges of sexual misconduct were brought about, though “no new evidence from ’05 to now has showed up, no stained clothing, no smoking gun, nothing.” They added that other jurors similarly expressed the view that “politics was involved.”

With any public event for a figure as polarizing as Cosby, the actor risks facing highly visible protests and scrutiny. “People have a right to protest,” says Wyatt. “We just ask that our supporters be respectful and not engage or incite anything … He has been consistent that people respect each other. He has used his entire career to humanize all age groups, races, genders and religious groups and he’ll continue to do that as he moves on with his life.”

Fox on Thursday announced that the seventh and final season will begin airing on Tuesday, April 10 at 9:30/8:30c. The abbreviated eight-episode run will then air uninterrupted for six weeks, leading up to the one-hour series finale on Tuesday, May 15 at 9/8c. (FWIW, your math isn’t wrong. The network will inevitably air back-to-back episodes at some point before the finale.)

As previously reported, Season 7 kicks off with a four-year time jump. After returning from a European book tour (that Julius Pepperwood novel must have really taken off!), Nick and Jess begin contemplating marriage. Potentially complicating matters is Jess’ decision to take a job working for ex-boyfriend Russell (again played by Dermot Mulroney).

In addition, Cece and Schmidt are now parents to three-year-old daughter Ruth, with Schmidt having made the transition to stay-at-home dad. Last but not least are Winston and Aly (recurring guest star Nasim Pedrad), who are now married and expecting their first child. Winston will also be reunited with his estranged father (Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s J.B. Smoove).

New Girl‘s farewell run will feature no shortage of guest stars. In addition to those mentioned above, One Mississippi‘s Tig Notaro has been cast in an as-yet specified role. Returning faces include Damon Wayans Jr. (Coach), David Walton (Sam), Nelson Franklin (Robby), Sam Richardson (Dunston), and Jamie Lee Curtis and Rob Reiner (as Jess’ parents).

334,"Tyga Detained by Police After Leaving Hollywood Nightclub UPDATE: The Los Angeles Police Department tells Us Weekly that Tyga was not arrested. “Today around 1:30 this morning in Hollywood division on Selma and Cherokee, Hollywood division officers conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle that had paper plates. Officers decided to conduct a field sobriety test. However, due to all the paparazzi at the location, officers decided to transfer Mr. Stevenson to Hollywood station,” the LAPD said. “He passed the field sobriety test and was released. He was cited for a minor traffic violation.”

Original story below

Tyga was detained by Los Angeles Police Department officers after leaving Hollywood’s Avenue nightclub in the early hours of Wednesday, April 12. Watch authorities take him into custody in the video above.

According to E! News, police pulled him over for running a stop sign and having no license plates. He spoke with several officers before voluntarily leaving his vehicle. The 27-year-old was then handcuffed and taken to the police station.

The “Rack City” rapper told paparazzi that he was being detained “because I have paper plates,” the website reports. He added that the Mercedes G Wagon he was driving was brand-new and that he “just bought it.” The hip-hop star had posted two Instagram photos flaunting the car earlier that day.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BStmiiODNns/

TMZ reports that he was taken into custody because he was suspected of a possible DUI. After Tyga spent about 90 minutes at the station, he was cleared and released with a traffic ticket.

As Us Weekly reported last week, the musician and his longtime girlfriend Kylie Jenner decided to take a break and give each other a space. After 10 months of living together at the reality star’s $6 million Hidden Hills, California, pad, Tyga moved out.

One issue for the on-off couple of three years: The “Still Got It” rapper was unhappy with his portrayal on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. “Tyga feels he’s been belittled on the show,” an insider told Us. However, “they’re not broken up,” another source added. “They’re just not spending as much time together.”

Meanwhile, the 19-year-old makeup mogul is getting her own spinoff show called Life of Kylie, E! announced on Monday, April 10. The eight-episode series will focus on her entrepreneurial ventures and friendship with BFF Jordyn Woods.

So many moms can relate to this.

Jessica Alba, the 36-year-old actress and entrepreneur, was out shopping with newborn son Hayes at Target on Friday when her baby need to breastfeed. Looking for a spot, Alba took to a fitting room.

jessicaalba / Instagram

Sharing the very real motherhood moment on Instagram, the actress and Honest Company co-founder captioned a selfie of her and newborn, writing: “Tired eyes,” and “Breastfeeding in a Target dressing room.”

Target has a mommy-friendly breastfeeding policy that reads supports nursing ""in any area of our stores, including our fitting rooms, even if others are waiting."" It's also been reported that Target has been testing out designated nursing stations at some locations. That's something we'd love to see more of!

The ""Dark Angel"" actress has been outspoken and proud about breastfeeding her 7-week-old, sharing updates on social media before the Golden Globes, while watching Netflix and even after going to the spa.

Hayes, born on New Year’s Eve, is Alba’s third child with husband Cash Warren, joining daughters Honor Marie, 9, and Haven Garner, 6.

Despite all of her successes, Alba still feels all of the typical pressures of motherhood, impromptu nursing breaks included.

“Any mom who all of the sudden has little people that rely heavily on them for survival needs to maintain her own sense of self,” Alba told TODAY. “You need to cut yourself some slack and bite off what you can chew. Things will be compromised and you just have to be okay with that.”

“I just pray that my kids are happy,” the strong mom said back in 2015. “If they’re giggling more than they’re crying, and if they’re curious and talkative, then I know they’re good.”",1

Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour[2] was the fifth concert tour by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, in support of her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017). The tour began on May 8, 2018 in Glendale and concluded on November 21, 2018 in Tokyo, comprising 53 concerts. The tour was attended by 2,888,892 fans and grossed $345,700,000 in revenue, becoming Swift’s most successful tour to date, and the 13th highest grossing concert tour of all time. The supporting acts for the tour were Charli XCX, Camila Cabello, and Broods.

A concert film of the same name was directed by Paul Dugdale and released on Netflix on December 31, 2018.[3] It was filmed at the second show in Arlington, Texas on October 6, 2018.

Development

In August 2017, Billboard reported that Swift would be using Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program to prevent bots and ticket scalpers from purchasing tickets. The program, named ""Taylor Swift Tix"", allowed fans to purchase tickets in advance of the public on-sale by participating in boost activities to increase chances of getting a pre-sale access code.[2][4]

On November 13, 2017, Swift's management announced the first round of dates for the tour jointly with Ticketmaster.[5][6] Tickets went on sale to the general public on December 13, 2017, the day of Swift's 28th birthday.

In late November, Swift announced shows in Manchester, Dublin, and London. Due to overwhelming demand, additional dates were announced for all three cities. Furthermore, the singer also announced extra shows in North America for Pasadena, Chicago, East Rutherford, Foxborough, Toronto, and Atlanta due to popular demand before the pre-sale began.[7][8] On December 3, Swift announced five dates for Oceania.[9][10] In January 2018, due to huge demand, Swift went on to add second dates in Santa Clara, Landover, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Arlington and third dates in East Rutherford and Foxborough, totalling 40 shows for the tour's North American leg.[11]

On March 1, 2018, Swift officially announced Camila Cabello and Charli XCX as the opening acts for the Reputation Stadium Tour.[12] Cabello was previously speculated as the opening act because her Never Be the Same Tour dates didn't coincide with Swift's tour dates;[13] Portland's Live 95.5 also announced her in a sweepstake for the concert of June 22, 2018 at the Wembley Stadium in London through a since-deleted post on Twitter, a day before Swift confirmed her as the opening act.[14]

On May 7, 2018, the day before the tour kicked off at Glendale, Arizona, Swift invited 2,000 foster and adopted children to a private dress rehearsal.[15]

On May 8, 2018, Swift announced two shows in Tokyo, with Charli XCX as the opening act.[16] In September 2018, Broods was announced as an opening act for the Oceania leg of the tour.[17]

Critical reception

The tour has received rave reviews, being commonly labeled as the best of Swift's career thus far and the best tour of 2018.[18][19][20] Ed Masley, from The Arizona Republic, wrote that ""there were many moments in the course Swift's performance that felt like she was playing to the back rows of the stadium by simply sharing with her fans"", while complimenting the tour's production and highlighting Swift's connection with the crowd.[21] Jim Harrington, from The Mercury News, praised the improvement of the singer's vocal work and performance skills over the years: ""Her game is well-rounded enough that she can excel equally at every different aspect of the show.""[22] Chris Tuite, from CBS San Francisco, wrote: ""The only thing more prominent than the singer herself during her current costume-change filled spectacle are the massive, vicious looking snakes that symbolically appear throughout the set.""[23] Michael Tritsch from 303 Magazine commented the tour ""broke new ground and set the bar high for future stadium tours"" while adding ""The reputation of this show burned its way into the history books"".[24]

Commercial performance

Ticket sales

After four days of sales through the Verified Fan platform and three days of sales to the general public that began December 13, the tour had already grossed $180 million from 33 dates in North America alone.[25] Pollstar reported data supplied by the Gridiron Stadium Network, a consortium of NFL facilities that work together to book concerts at their buildings, which showed at least 35,000 tickets had been sold at ten of the stadiums on the route as of December 18. The tickets sold ranged from 35,419 at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh to a high of 48,039 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. With more than 47,000 tickets sold, it was reported the May 12, 2018 date at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara was generating close to $9 million in ticket revenue, which prompted the addition of an extra date.[26]

According to StubHub, the tour is the best-selling female tour in the United Kingdom in 2018.[27]

Boxscore

The first seven shows of the tour grossed $54 million with 390,000 tickets sold, leading Swift to the top of Billboard's Hot Tours chart in June 2018.[28] She performed to sold out crowds of 59,157 in Glendale and 107,550 in Santa Clara (over two nights), grossing $7.21 million and $14 million respectively, while the Pasadena shows combined for a gross of nearly $16.3 million and Seattle accounted more than $8.6 million.[28][29][30] The concerts in Louisville and Columbus, reported in July 2018, grossed $11.5 million with around 115,000 tickets sold, with the latter city having the highest gross and most tickets sold, with approximately 63,000 tickets and $6.6 million. These concerts led the singer once again to the top of Hot Tours chart.[31]

Records

The tour has broken multiple venue attendance and grossing records. The debut performance at University of Phoenix Stadium set new venue records in both gross and attendance, topping Metallica's $5.2 million gross earned in August 2017 by almost $2 million. With 59,157 tickets sold, she also broke the attendance record set during One Direction's Where We Are Tour in 2014 by 2,633 seats.[32] With a $14 million take from 107,550 sold tickets at Levi's Stadium she topped her own gross and attendance counts set during The 1989 World Tour in 2015. With more than 118,000 fans in attendance at the Rose Bowl, the two-show run earned $16.2 million and set a new gross record for a single headliner at the venue, surpassing U2's 2017 record by over $467,000.

Swift made history by becoming the first female artist to headline Dublin's Croke Park twice, with reportedly 136,000 fans in attendance.[33][34] Similarly, she achieved the milestone of becoming the first woman to headline three consecutive nights at MetLife Stadium[35] and Gillette Stadium.[36]

Following the tour's 29th show in North America at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, it had grossed $202.3 million in the continent ($191.1 million in the United States and $11.1 million in Canada) thus breaking Swift's own record of the highest grossing North American tour by a female artist, previously held by The 1989 World Tour, with fewer dates.[37]

338,"Barbra Streisand and James Brolin Net Worth Megastar Barbra Streisand and popular actor James Brolin first met on the set of Capricorn One in 1970, a film in which her first husband Elliot Gould also starred. Barbra Streisand and Elliot Gould had a son named Jason in 1967. Jason appeared in the film The Prince of Tides as Barbra's onscreen son. Streisand and Brolin married in 1998 in the intimate setting of Streisand's Maibu, California living room in the presence of 105 guests, including the likes of John Travolta and wife Kellly Preston, record producer Quincy Jones and Streisand's 89-year-old mother. ""We wanted to be surrounded by people we've loved for a long time,"" says Streisand. Born Barbara Joan Streisand (Barbara 'with' the second 'a'), Streisand made the decision early in her career to drop the second 'a' from her name so that 'Barbra' would have a more original spelling, rather than change her name. Though she became a huge movie star and singing legend, Streisand had to be convinced that she was a truly gifted singer, as her initial ambition was to be an actress who sang rather than being known for her signing. Born Craig Kenneth Bruderlin, James Brolin was widely known for his role as Dr/ Steven Kiley on the 1969-1976 television series Marcus Welby, M.D. James Brolin is the father of actor Josh Brolin.",1
339,"Sophie Turner Is Ridiculously Hot in First 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix' Photos The Phoenix, beautiful and deadly, seems captivated by her own power in the new first-look photos published on Thursday. And while the rest of the X-Men are present throughout, Sophie Turner’s Jean Grey is at the forefront of the mayhem.

The photos, published by Entertainment Weekly, give X-Men fans a first look at the next film in the saga, X-Men: Dark Phoenix.

Set almost 10 years after the events of X-Men: Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix is looking to redeem the X-Men universe of the tragedy that was X-Men: The Last Stand (2006); The Last Stand originally acted as a crude adaptation of Marvel’s The Dark Phoenix Saga (1980), which the upcoming Dark Phoenix is based on, as well.

But just what is this story about? It’s nice of you to ask. In the Dark Phoenix Saga, the X-Men are making their way back to Earth from an off-planet mission and get caught up in a solar flare. Jean Grey (recently portrayed by Turner in the films) sacrifices herself and is exposed to a ridiculous amount of radiation that briefly unlocks her full psychic potential. With this power, she embodies the “Phoenix,” a terrifyingly deadly alter ego without much self-control. Throughout Saga, Phoenix battles the X-Men, commits genocide, and aligns herself with former enemies in order to gain more power.

As the upcoming Dark Phoenix is expected to emulate the Dark Phoenix Saga, Charles Xavier’s X-Men should probably be on the lookout for a total meltdown.

Here’s, presumably, the event that causes Jean’s transformation above Earth.

340,"The Evolution of Cameron Diaz's Career From 'The Mask' to 'The Other Woman' With no major awards to her name (yet) and a career that's sometimes been overshadowed by her off-screen romances or her headline-grabbing quotes, it's unfortunately too easy to brush aside Cameron Diaz's impressive, long-lasting, and unique resume in Hollywood. At 41-years-old, and exactly 20 years since she burst on to the scene in the smash comedy The Mask, Diaz is still sitting pretty on the A-list. This year alone she has three major projects on her docket: two comedies, including The Other Woman and Sex Tape, as well as the remake of the musical Annie.

The model-turned-actress has a career that has exceeded many expectations, one that has included multi-million dollar franchises (Shrek, Charlie's Angels), critically-praised performances (Being John Malkovich, In Her Shoes), raunchy comedy hits (There's Something About Mary, Bad Teacher), eye-raising indies (Vanilla Sky, The Counselor), mainstream rom-coms (My Best Friend's Wedding, What To Expect When You're Expecting), and even a Best Picture nominee (The Gangs of New York). While there have been, of course, some misfires (The Box, Knight and Day, among others), Diaz has kept things interesting, not only for herself, but for audiences and critics alike.

In anticipation The Other Woman, the comedy which Diaz stars alongside with Leslie Mann and Kate Upton and opens in theaters this Thursday, we look back at the evolution of her screen career.

1994 - 1999: A Star is Born

In 1994, it was all about Jim Carrey. The guy was everywhere. But leave it to Cameron Diaz to upstage him at the absolute height of his fame. Diaz skyrocketed to breakout star status when she played Carrey's va-va-voom love interest in the manic comedy The Mask. The movie, which went on to earn $119 million at the box office, launched Diaz's career and made her a household name in the '90s. While Diaz mostly played sidekicks or love interests, sometimes with good results (My Best Friend's Wedding), but mostly with not-so-good results (Very Bad Things, Feeling Minnesota, A Life Less Ordinary) none of that mattered by 1998. Because thanks to one shocking hairdo in one seriously un-PC, but hilarious Farrelly Brothers comedy, everyone knew Diaz could hold her own.

Diaz played the titular, fawned-over Mary in There's Something About Mary, an R-rated comedy that would earn $176 million at the box office and proved that the fearless Diaz was just as funny, if not funnier, than the guys dominating the comedy scene in the '90s like Ben Stiller. But Diaz's most daring transformation happened in 1999 when she played the frizzy, frazzled Lotte in the Oscar-nominated mind-bender Being John Malkovich.

While she was a natural at comedy, it was Spike Jonze that opened a new portal to Diaz's talents beyond being goofy and giggly. As Roger Ebert marveled in his glowing review of the film, ""Cameron Diaz, one of the best-looking women in movies, who here looks so dowdy we hardly recognize her; Diaz has fun with her talent by taking it incognito to strange places and making it work for a living."" (Diaz earned Golden Globe nominations for her performances in both Being John Malkovich and There's Something About Mary.)

2000 - 2005: The Really Big Time

The early 2000s were, without question, the most successful of Diaz's career. In 2000 the big screen Charlie's Angels reboot was a girl power powerhouse that spawned a 2003 sequel that brought in a combined $350 million in the U.S. alone. Diaz also lent her voice as Princess Fiona to the animated juggernaut that was the Shrek saga. The original Shrek was released in 2000, won an Oscar, and had three follow-ups (2004's Shrek 2, 2007's Shrek the Third, and 2010's Shrek Forever After) which comined all totaled over $1 billion in box office receipts.

In addition to her blockbusters, Diaz teamed up with acclaimed directors Cameron Crowe and Martin Scorsese to mixed results with 2001's Vanilla Sky (audiences didn't warm to it, but it earned Diaz her third Globe nomination) and 2002's Gangs of New York (a hit that earned Diaz her fourth-career Globe nod), respectively. The actress also tried to recreate the gross-out magic of There's Something About Mary, but failed to do so with 2002's critically panned The Sweetest Thing. She fared far better when she appeared alongside Toni Collette in the 2005 family dramedy In Her Shoes, a movie that showed some of Diaz's best acting and range to date.

2006 - 2010: A Rough Patch

While 2006's sugary ensemble rom-com The Holiday was a moderate hit ($63 million), what followed wasn't so sweet. Diaz starred in a series of flicks that both audiences and critics turned away from, including the mind-numbing 2008 comedy What Happens in Vegas, the emotionally manipulative 2009 drama My Sister's Keeper, 2009's so-laughably-bad-it's-bad thriller The Box, and 2010's Tom Cruise reunion gone awry Knight and Day. Hey, ya can't win 'em all.

2011 - Current: Back in the Groove?

Okay, so 2011's The Green Hornet sucked, but that was through no fault of Diaz's own. Plus, she bounced back rather nicely later that year with the comedy Bad Teacher, a movie she carried all the past the $100 million mark at the box office. While 2012 and 2013 brought Diaz two of the worst-reviewed movies of her career, Gambit (a mere 19 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and the polarizing The Counselor (all anyone could really talk about was that car scene), 2014 looks to be one of the star's most noteworthy years in quite some time with the triple threat of The Other Woman, Sex Tape, and Annie.

The Desperate Housewives beauty first met the 50-year-old Televisa president through a mutual friend back in 2013, and they wed two years ago.

'Oh my god, [I feel] horrible. I have to pee right now and I just peed. I'm tired. Everything hurts. I can do one thing a day. I'm exhausted,' the mother-to-be said on an episode of Conan last month.

'Anyone who knew me, knew Jinxy. He will be missed by many. I love you Jinxy' Eva wrote in her heartbreaking Instagram post

'He's beyond kicking. He's, like, doing flamenco on my bladder. He, like, moves [around]!'

The Golden Globe nominee also revealed that since being pregnant, she no longer craves chicken, coffee, or wine.

342,"Rihanna Wants to Time-Travel Back to the Day She Lost Her Virginity Rihanna is killing the game right now. The pop star just launched her first makeup line, Fenty Beauty, her song with DJ Khaled, ""Wild Thoughts,"" is rocking the Billboard charts, and she's still hanging out with that Saudi billionaire she was first spotted kissing over the summer. (RiRi tried to hide him under an umbrella-ella last month, but the Internet wasn't fooled!) All of Rihanna's body-shamers need to sit down, because she's on top of the world.

But even though Rihanna is ubiquitous, there's still a lot we don't know about her—as this new interview with Elle proves. The singer covers several topics during her recent chat with the magazine—including why lipstick is her ""secret weapon""—but the most interesting tidbit involves time travel.

One of Rihanna's friends, magician David Copperfield, asked her where she'd go if she was magically zapped anywhere in the world, and her answer was pretty surprising.

""Ten minutes before I lost my virginity,"" Rihanna told Copperfield, who said that he actually can make her disappear and reappear any place on Earth. (Not sure if he was kidding or not.)

Interesting, right? There was no follow-up to this question. Rihanna didn't explain why she'd transport back to the day she lost her virginity or when exactly this was. It's a curious thought, though. Losing your virginity is typically a very awkward and vulnerable experience. I certainly wouldn't want to repeat that day—it seems like Rihanna might want to prevent it from happening altogether.

Leave it to Rihanna to give the most mysterious and intriguing answer to this question. Most people would've just said the Bahamas. OK, I would've said the Bahamas.

344,"Pregnant Claire Danes Says Filming ‘Homeland’ During First Trimester Was 'Embarrassing' Claire Danes may have put her pregnancy out in the open on Wednesday, but while she was filming the most recent season of Homeland, she had to keep quiet.

“I’m knocked up!” she jokingly announced on Wednesday’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

The 39-year-old actress revealed she was in her first trimester of pregnancy while filming her hit drama, calling the time her “least favorite phase.”

“You just feel horrible. You just feel rotten and you’re not allowed to say why,” she explained to host Fallon. “I was filming quite a lot and just inadvertently falling asleep all the time. It was just embarrassing.”

Revealing she “face planted” onto a crocheted bag in between takes, Danes noted that she had a rude awakening when it was time for her close up.

“I have this crocheted indentation all on the side of my face. It looked like I had third degree burns,” she said of the marks. “They were massaging my face. They had to get out the blow dryer. I halted production for a good half an hour. I felt like an idiot.”

These days, she’s in the “cruisy second trimester.”

“It gets a little excited when I have a chocolate bar. It’s moving and kicking,” she said of her second child. “I love that part. It’s like a fireworks show every so often. It’s really cool and a little creepy. It is, it’s like an alien being in there, cohabitating, yeah, AirBNB.”

Danes announced her second pregnancy during Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show on Wednesday after being asked about the love scenes on Homeland, which airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Showtime.

The actress and her husband, Hugh Dancy, are already parents to 5-year-old son Cyrus.

Stephens, whose parents were friends with the now disgraced doctor, said he repeatedly sexually abused her when she was a child. (Jan. 16) AP

Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who pleaded guilty in November to criminal sexual conduct, is being sentenced this week on seven sexual assault charges. The sentencing began Tuesday and is expected to conclude on Friday in Lansing, Mich. Nassar faces up to a life sentence, with a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.

Close to 90 women are slated to read victim impact statements at his hearing this week. But former gymnast and Nassar victim McKayla Maroney — who first shared her story of abuse over Twitter — faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks out. Maroney signed a nondisclosure agreement in December 2016, agreeing to stay quiet about the abuse she experienced as part of a $1.25 million settlement with USA Gymnastics.

Chrissy Teigen, a swimsuit model and TV host, does not want Maroney to remain silent. Teigen tweeted on Tuesday that she would ""be absolutely honored to pay"" the $100,000 fine for Maroney. Teigen called Nassar a ""serial monster"" in her tweet, while questioning the ""entire principle"" of the fine.

Maroney is suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University, claiming the nondisclosure agreement she signed was illegal.

USA Gymnastics said last month that the settlement terms from the 2016 agreement were initially not drawn up by its lawyers but rather by Maroney's attorney.

Maroney claims in her lawsuit filed last month that USA Gymnastics tried to prevent her from publicly accusing Nassar of sexual abuse in order to allow him to quietly leave USA Gymnastics and ""further silencing his victims."" In the lawsuit filed to Los Angeles Superior Court, Maroney alleges she was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement as part of the financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment.

""USA Gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from McKayla Maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar, nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to Larry Nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing,"" USA Gymnastics said in a statement.

""This has been her right and USA Gymnastics encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out. USA Gymnastics remains focused on our highest priority — the safety, health and well-being of our athletes and creating a culture that empowers and supports them.""

Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas have also revealed they were molested by Nassar.

350,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle marry in trailblazing ceremony Windsor, England (CNN) Britain's Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle sealed their wedding vows with a kiss on the steps outside St. George's Chapel in Windsor on Saturday, after a groundbreaking ceremony that didn't challenge royal norms so much as drive a gilded coach and horses through them.

This 15th century royal peculiar -- a church under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch -- echoed to the sounds of a fiery Chicago preacher, a soulful gospel choir and the first black winner of a prestigious British music prize, as a constellation of A-list Americans rubbed shoulders with the bluest-blooded of British royalty.

If anyone came expecting a traditional high-church British state occasion, they must have left sorely disappointed. For everyone else, including the millions who tuned in across the world, this was an electrifying affair that will live long in the memory.

Convention was broken almost from the start. After ascending the 20 or so steps to the chapel's West Door, the bride entered to a traditional fanfare by the State Trumpeters . But then, instead of the customary rousing organ voluntary -- Bach or Wagner, perhaps -- Meghan set off down the aisle to a haunting and ethereal cantata composed by Handel for the birthday of Queen Anne in 1714.

In a striking image, the outspoken biracial American divorcée walked unescorted, followed by her 10 bridesmaids and page boys

Almost every part of the ceremony made a statement. Meghan's elegant white dress with an open bateau neckline was by British designer Clare Waight Keller, the first female artistic director for the Givenchy fashion house. The 16-foot-long veil was held in place by a diamond bandeau tiara lent to her by the Queen.

Meghan walks down the aisle in St George's Chapel.

Only when she reached the chapel's Quire was Markle accompanied for her final steps to the foot of the altar by Prince Charles, Harry's father. Even then, he stepped back. There was no one needed to ""give her away.""

Harry, flanked by his brother and best man Prince William, looked emotional as he waited for Meghan, dressed in the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals. As she reached his side, Harry appeared to say: ""You look amazing. I missed you.""

JUST WATCHED Bishop Michael Curry's royal wedding sermon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bishop Michael Curry's royal wedding sermon 13:43

Harry and Meghan exchange vows.

Hands clasped, the couple listened to a stirring, soulful address by Bishop Michael Curry , the first African-American head of the Episcopal Church in the United States. Extemporising in the custom of American episcopalianism, Curry invoked the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. to deliver a powerful ode to love.""We must discover the power of love, the power, the redemptive power of love,"" he thundered. ""And when we do that, we will make of this whole world a new world. But love, love is the only way.""

His impassioned preaching style was a marked departure from the usually conservative tone of a British royal wedding. Harry could be seen saying ""Wow"" to Meghan as Curry's speech ended. Other members of the royal family looked decidedly bemused.

It was followed by a performance of the Ben E. King classic ""Stand by Me"" by The Kingdom Choir, a group of 20 gospel singers, another of the elements that gave the ceremony an air of diversity that has been almost entirely absent from any royal wedding that has gone before.

Only with the couple's marriage vows did the ceremony come closer to resembling a traditional state occasion -- but even then the language was unconventional for a royal ceremony. Harry and Meghan chose the colloquial texts of Common Worship, the standard Church of England liturgy published in 2000, over the distinctly more austere phrasing of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer used for the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.

There was no promise by Markle to ""obey"" her husband. Rather, she pledged to ""love him, comfort him, honor and protect him."" Harry chose to wear a wedding ring , unlike his brother.

Meghan was all smiles as she said her vows and gave Harry his wedding ring. The crowd could be faintly heard cheering outside as the couple were proclaimed husband and wife by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, the most senior cleric in the Church of England.

Harry and Meghan kiss outside the West Door.

As they signed the register, the rich tones of the cello played by award-winning young musician Sheku Kanneh-Mason again emphasized the couple's desire to break the mold. The ceremony ended with the Etta James version of ""Amen/This Little Light of Mine,"" a gospel song that became synonymous with the US civil rights movement.

After their joyful kiss on the steps, the couple -- now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- then set off on a procession through the streets of Windsor in an open carriage drawn by four Windsor Grey horses.

They were waved off by a bridal party that included Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, as well as the couple's godchildren and the children of their closest friends.

Well-wishers take pictures as Harry and Meghan pass in their carriage.

More than 100,000 people thronged the streets to cheer the couple as they passed, authorities said. Some had camped out for days to get the best possible spot, while others rose before dawn to make their way to Windsor amid a party atmosphere.

The biggest cheers were reserved for Meghan and Harry, though Princess Charlotte drew some ""awwws"" after appearing on the big screen. As people began to disperse and head towards the exits, it began to dawn that an event that so many had looked forward to for so long was over. ""Mummy, can we do it all again tomorrow?"" one little girl asked.

The Queen, wearing a lime silk dress, was accompanied by Prince Philip. Hours before the ceremony, Elizabeth conferred the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel on Prince Harry, making Meghan the first-ever Duchess of Sussex.

A host of other royals were also present, including the Princess Royal, Prince Andrew and his daughters, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. Catherine's sister Pippa Middleton and their parents also attended.

Guests from Markle's side included her mother, Doria Ragland , who watched with tears in her eyes as her daughter walked down the aisle.

Also present were cast members from ""Suits"" -- the legal drama in which she made her name -- including Abigail Spencer, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Gabriel Macht.

Amal and George Clooney arrive on Saturday.

The presence of Harry's late mother, Princess Diana, was also subtly felt at the ceremony. ""Guide me o thou great redeemer"" was sung at Diana's funeral, at her memorial service in 2007 and at Kate and William's wedding in 2011, and again on Saturday.

Harry's aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister, gave the reading from the Book of Solomon.

Meghan's father, Thomas Markle Sr ., was supposed to attend until health concerns ruled him out. But in remarks to the US celebrity website TMZ, he said his daughter looked ""beautiful"" and described her wedding as ""emotional and joyful .""

All 600 of the guests were invited to an afternoon reception hosted by the Queen at Windsor Castle's St. George's Hall, at which Elton John -- who was a friend of Princess Diana -- performed.

The guests were also to enjoy the famously non-traditional lemon and elderflower sponge cake chosen by Harry and Meghan.

The wedding cake is to be served at the Reception. It was designed by Claire Ptak and features elderflower syrup made at The Queen's residence in Sandringham from the estate's own elderflower trees, as well as a light sponge cake uniquely formulated for the couple. #royalwedding pic.twitter.com/kt5lE4tEn9 — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 19, 2018

Only 200 of the couple's closest friends and family will celebrate with them into the night at a second, evening reception hosted by Prince Charles at Frogmore House, south of Windsor Castle. In one last departure from custom, the bride will give a speech.

Meghan, who began the day as a TV star, will end it by Harry's side as the newly minted Duchess of Sussex, whose thoroughly modern wedding broke the royal mold.",1
351,"How To Shop Like ‘This Is Us’ Star Chrissy Metz While she sometimes wears custom, one-of-a-kind outfits when strolling the red carpet, “This is Us” star Chrissy Metz has also been known to wear clothes all of us non-celebrities can purchase too.

The actress has struggled with weight her entire life and even started doing Weight Watchers when she was 11 years old. She says her family struggled to get by when she was growing up and she turned to food for comfort. Because of her size, she says some of the most difficult experiences she had during her childhood revolved around back-to-school shopping.

“It was terrible. I had to settle for clothes. I wanted cute little cutoff shorts, but I had to get the longer ones because of my thighs. I thought, ‘Maybe I could cut them and maybe I could make them my own,’” she told People magazine last year. “It was really hard. My younger sister is thin and she would always be wearing cute clothes, so I had no one to talk to.”

Now, Metz isn’t afraid to wear what she wants and show off her personality in her fashion choices. For example, the latex dress she wore at the MTV Movie & TV Awards that she said made people “get rowdy”.

Where To Get Some Of Metz’s Best Looks For Yourself

Despite now having access to some of the world’s most in-demand designers and labels, Metz has revealed she shops at popular plus-size clothing stores, like Eloquii, where she purchased a $139 tie-neck ruffle-sleeve dress that she wore at the Critics’ Choice Awards. In this case, Metz’s stylist did make the dress slightly longer, but the original can be purchased online.

She also wore a faux leather jacket to her 36th birthday party from Avenue. While that jacket appears to no longer be available, the retailer has other coats online that cost $100 or less.

The latest fashion news from the star is even better for anyone that’s looking to replicate her style. Loft, the sister brand of Ann Taylor, is now offering plus-size clothing and Metz has already been seen in two of its dresses.

In September 2017, Metz wore a polka dot wrap midi dress for an appearance on NBC’s “Late Night With Seth Meyers.” The cost? Only $89!

Another $89 find that the actress has been seen wearing is the paisley wrap midi dress from Loft, which she rocked at a pre-Golden Globe Awards party in January.

Loft Plus has sizes ranging from 16 to 26, with prices from about $20 to $110. The entire line is available online.

Before she found her style through custom outfits and plus-size clothing lines, Metz told People magazine she used to design her own, “because otherwise you’d look like someone’s grandma and you’re 14.”

Now, the actress says she is even planning a clothing line for the future to help all women, regardless of their size, feel confident in what they’re wearing.

“We need to be specific about how clothing fits different body shapes,” she told the magazine. “I want to show personality, and make something that I want to wear. If I don’t want to wear it, I would not want to sell it.”

It looks like Robert Pattinson is looking back at his ""Twilight"" experience with a positive light.

On Monday, Robert Pattinson was in attendance for the 27th Annual IFP Gotham Awards in New York City where he was nominated for his new film ""Good Time."" But before he headed straight for the prestigious event, the 31-year-old actor lounged around the red carpet and dished about his experiences with an entirely different film: The ""Twilight"" saga.

It had been five years since the final ""Twilight"" film had been released, ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part Two,"" and in an interview with E! News, the actor was reminded of this event and he could only share how ""amazing"" of an experience it was for him to be involved in such a film.

""It's all fond memories,"" Pattinson remarked about filming the ""Twilight"" movies. ""I mean it's almost more fond the further away you get from it ... it's just such a magical way to spend your 20s.""

""I mean it's completely crazy. I still haven't really processed it. I mean I always thought that there'd be more of a fallout—a psychological fallout years later,"" the actor adds.

His remarks about the film come just a week after his ex-girlfriend and fellow ""Twilight"" star Kristen Stewart dished about her own experiences filming the franchise. In fact, she was actually surprised that so much time had already gone by since they filmed the last ""Twilight"" film. Stewart had also shared how lucky she was to have been part of such an experience and that she has taken a lot from the franchise going so far as to say that the film series has made her what she is today.

Is there anything baby Asahd can’t do?

DJ Khaled‘s son has taken the world by storm, stealing the spotlight at award shows, amassing a large social media following and rubbing elbows with some of music’s biggest stars. Most recently, he’s helped his father overcome one of his biggest fears: flying.

“I haven’t flown in 10 years. In 10 years!” the 41-year-old producer said in a recent Instagram of himself on a jet with the 10-month-old perched on his lap. “That’s the only thing I had was fear of flying. Asahd made me overcome my fear of flying.”

He then turned to the little boy and said, “I love you.”

Khaled and his longtime love, Nicole Tuck, welcomed their son in October 2016. Naturally, Khaled documented the entire process on his favorite app, Snapchat.

The actress has booked her first major post-Grey’s Anatomy gig, joining the cast of Madam Secretary as a series regular, EW has learned.

Ramirez will debut during the Sunday, Nov. 17 episode as Kat Sandoval, a brilliant political strategist, legendary in D.C. for her talent and for abruptly dropping out of politics until Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord (Téa Leoni) manages to coax her back into the State Department.

The news comes on the heels of the departure of Bebe Neuwirth, an original cast member who played McCord’s chief of staff Nadine Tolliver, earlier this week.

“We’re very excited that Sara is joining the cast,” says creator Barbara Hall. “She brings a fresh perspective and a fun, energetic quality to the State Department staff.”

Adds executive producer Lori McCreary: “We are thrilled to have Sara join the Madam Secretary State Department team. From the moment she walked on set with her talent, intellect, and spirit, she became part of the family!”

The Tony-award winning actress is best known for starring as Dr. Callie Torres on Grey’s Anatomy for more than a decade, exiting in 2016 at the end of season 12 amid contract negotiations for the main cast members. Hope for the actress to return to the long-running medical drama seemed to diminish after Ramirez called out ABC over an offensive joke about bisexual people during an episode of The Real O’Neals; in addition to playing a bisexual character on Grey’s, Ramirez also identifies as bisexual.

Ramirez also lends her voice to the animated series Sofia the First.

Swift joined country songwriter Craig Wiseman on stage for a acoustic performance, reports The Tennessean.

The Bluebird is a Nashville landmark known for hosting some of country music's best songwriters and musicians, and the occasional megastar. On Saturday, Wiseman casually invited Swift to join him on stage at the venue where she used to play before her rise to fame.

Swift took the stage and talked to the audience about her early days, when she moved to Nashville at just 14 to learn more about songwriting. The singer played ""Shake It Off"" as an example of how catchy three chords can be. Swift also played ""Better Man,"" a Grammy-nominated song she wrote for Little Big Town. She said she appreciated hearing a song she wrote played by someone else.

""When I would play writers nights ... I didn't have the experience of a writer writing something and then it going out into the world and you earing it from someone else's perspective until recently,"" Swift said, reports The Tennessean. ""Little Big Town gave me the opportunity to feel that way ... to be at the Bluebird and play a song you've maybe heard on the radio. I will always be forever grateful to them for that.""

Swift closed off her surprise performance with a song she said Wiseman did not ""get"" when she first wrote it at 17. The pop star said that after Wiseman told her he didn't get it, the two worked on another song instead, but when Swift when home, she finished writing the original song.

""This is the song I almost wrote with Craig Wiseman,"" Swift told the crowd. ""It's called 'Love Story.'""

""Love Story"" became an eight-time platinum hit.

The Tennessean reports that Swift's performance was filmed for a documentary on the 35th anniversary of the Bluebird Cafe. Swift got her first break there, when Big Machine Label Group's Scott Borchetta saw her play the room when she was an 8th grader. He offered her a record deal.",1

Decided October 3, 2008 ; 10 years ago ( ) Verdict Guilty on all 12 counts Case history Subsequent action(s) O.J. Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison with eligibility for parole in 9 years.

He was released from prison on October 1, 2017. Court membership Judge(s) sitting Jackie Glass

The O. J. Simpson robbery case (officially State of Nevada v. Orenthal James Simpson, et al.) was a criminal case prosecuted in 2007–2008 in the U.S. state of Nevada, primarily involving the retired American football player O. J. Simpson. On the night of September 13, 2007, a group of men led by Simpson entered a room in the Palace Station hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia dealer, testified that the group of men broke into his hotel room and stole various sports memorabilia at gunpoint.[1] Three days later, on September 16, 2007, Simpson was arrested for his involvement in the robbery and held without bail.[2] He admitted taking the items, which he said had been stolen from him, but denied breaking into the room. Simpson also denied the allegation that he or the people with him carried weapons.[3][4]

On October 3, 2008—exactly 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown, and Ronald Goldman—Simpson was found guilty of all 10 charges. On December 5, 2008, Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison with eligibility for parole in nine years (in October 2017). On July 20, 2017, Simpson was granted parole,[5] and was freed on October 1, 2017.[6]

Robbery [ edit ]

Alfred Beardsley, a memorabilia dealer, contacted Tom Riccio, another memorabilia dealer, regarding a trove of O. J. Simpson items Beardsley had in Las Vegas. Riccio then informed Simpson of the items. Claiming that the memorabilia were stolen from him, Simpson, along with Riccio, devised a plan to confront the dealers and get them back. Simpson, who was already planning on going to Las Vegas for a wedding, recruited some wedding guests for the operation.[7] The robbery was planned at Palms Casino Resort.[8] Bruce Fromong, another memorabilia dealer and a friend of Simpson's, met with Beardsley and Riccio in room 1203 at the Palace Station, a room Riccio had rented. Beardsley had contacted Fromong about a client hoping to buy a large amount of O. J. Simpson memorabilia; Fromong was unaware the client was Simpson.[7][9] Riccio had Beardsley and Fromong move the items into the room and spread the memorabilia on the bed to create a display.[10] After a pre-wedding dinner, Simpson and five accomplices drove to the Palace Station, where they met Riccio in the lobby.[7][10] After some confusion over the room's location, Simpson's party entered the room at 7:38 PM.[7][8]

When the group entered the room, Simpson ordered his group to not allow anybody to leave.[10] Simpson and Beardsley proceeded to argue over where the memorabilia came from.[7] During the confrontation, accomplice Michael McClinton threatened Fromong with a gun.[8] Simpson's group then stuffed O. J. Simpson memorabilia, along with autographed Pete Rose baseballs and Joe Montana lithographs, into pillowcases.[11][8] The party then returned to the Palms Casino Resort.[8] The confrontation lasted about six minutes.[12]

Involved parties [ edit ]

Stood by Simpson during the trial and did not negotiate a plea deal. Judge Jackie Glass sentenced Stewart, the only Simpson cohort who did not negotiate a plea deal, to 15 years in prison, eligible for parole after 7 and a 1/2 years. The conviction was later overturned because the verdict was tainted by Simpson's fame, and Stewart was released after a plea deal with time served. [13]

Simpson's attorneys [ edit ]

Yale Galanter was an attorney who had represented Simpson in Florida prior to this incident. According to Simpson, Galanter encouraged Simpson to retrieve his personal items. Galanter was with Simpson in Las Vegas prior to the robbery. The former star athlete said Galanter told him during a dinner discussion in Las Vegas, ""you have the right to get your stuff"", but cautioned he could not trespass on private property. Simpson said he told Galanter that if the suit he wore during his sensational 1990s murder trial was included among the memorabilia, he planned to burn it, and Galanter responded: ""You're not going to burn it, you're going to bring it to me.""[21] In his testimony, Simpson stated that he gave the property stolen in Las Vegas to Galanter.[22] Simpson testified that he paid Galanter $125,000 to make a video montage for the appeal, but no video montage was ever made.[23] Simpson's attempt to secure a new trial centered around his claim that Galanter was incompetent and had a conflict of interest [24] but this argument was rejected by the trial court and the state Supreme Court.[25]

Gabriel L. Grasso, Galanter's former friend and co-counsel, said the lawyer complained during the case that he did not have money to hire investigators or an expert to analyze a critical audio recording from the night of the heist.[24]

Investigation and trial [ edit ]

Investigators initially named Simpson a suspect, but questioned him the next day and released him soon after. On September 15, one of the accomplices, Walter Alexander, was arrested and charged with two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, one count of conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of burglary with a deadly weapon. Alexander was on his way to McCarran International Airport when he was approached by the police. Earlier in the day, two guns were recovered when the police executed a warrant at one of the men's homes.

On September 16, Simpson was arrested by Clark County, Nevada, authorities.[26] The celebrity gossip website TMZ.com published an audio recording of the incident which indicated Simpson and others shouted at the occupants of the room and demanded the return of various items.[27] On the audiotape, recorded by Thomas Riccio, Simpson is heard saying: ""Don't let nobody out of this room. ... Motherfucker, you think you can steal my shit and sell it?""[28] An FBI expert witness claimed that the tapes had ""over-recordings"" and ""might"" have been altered.[15] Riccio reportedly said he tipped off Simpson to go to the hotel to look for his goods, and he reportedly said he deliberately planted the recording device to prove to Simpson that Beardsley and Fromong were fencing his stuff. Riccio considers Simpson a friend, and brought Simpson to the room and escorted him and the memorabilia out.[29]

On the day after the incident, in a 20-minute interview with the L.A. Times, Simpson brushed off the allegations saying, ""I'm O. J. Simpson. How am I going to think that I'm going to rob somebody and get away with it? Besides, I thought what happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas... You've got to understand, this ain't somebody going to steal somebody's drugs or something like that. This is somebody going to get his private [belongings] back. That's it. That's not robbery."" [30]

In an interview, Walter Alexander said he thought the whole incident was a setup to get Simpson. He does not ""understand what the big deal is"", or why Riccio would set this whole operation up, tape it and then sell the tape to the media.[31] Alexander's ex-wife gave an interview to the New York Times in which she said many people carry tape recorders with them around Simpson to try and catch him slipping so they can profit from it. During police questioning, Alexander said Simpson asked for guns to be carried to look tough but that the guns would not be used. He also added that McClinton impersonated a police officer and acted too rough to the surprise of the others, including Simpson. He claims Simpson repeatedly told McClinton to ""calm down, calm down.""[32]

Simpson appeared in court on September 19, 2007. Represented by attorneys from Florida and Nevada, Simpson was granted a bail of $125,000. Presiding Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure, Jr., stated that Simpson was not allowed to have any contact with any of the co-defendants, and must surrender his passport. Simpson did not enter a plea.[33][34] Both Clarence Stewart and O. J. Simpson were charged with:

Count 1: Conspiracy to commit a crime

Count 2: Conspiracy to commit kidnapping

Count 3: Conspiracy to commit robbery

Count 4: Burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon

Count 5: 1st degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong)

Count 6: 1st degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley)

Count 7: Robbery with use of a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong)

Count 8: Robbery with use of a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley)

Count 9: Assault with a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong)

Count 10: Assault with a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley)

Count 11: Coercion with a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong as an alternative to count 5)

Count 12: Coercion with a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley as an alternative to count 6)

Simpson's order to not allow anybody to leave the room was the reason for the kidnapping charges.[35]

The trial began on September 8, 2008, in the court of Nevada District Court Judge Jackie Glass, before an all-white jury,[36] in stark contrast to Simpson's earlier murder trial.[37] On October 3, 2008, Simpson was found guilty of all charges. On October 10, 2008, Simpson's attorneys, Yale Galanter and Gabriel Grasso, PC, moved for new trial (trial de novo) on grounds of judicial errors (two jurors of the same race as Simpson were dismissed) and insufficient evidence. Clarence ""C. J."" Stewart's attorney, E. Brent Bryson, also petitioned for new trial, alleging Stewart should have been tried separately, and cited perceived misconduct by the jury foreman. Galanter and Stewart later appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court after Judge Glass denied their motions, and the defendants were found guilty. In October 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Simpson's convictions, while Stewart's appeal was accepted.[38] Stewart was released in January 2011 after entering an Alford plea and being sentenced to 9 months house arrest and 3 years probation.[citation needed] Galanter motioned for a rehearing of the Simpson appeal in November 2010, which was denied by the Nevada Supreme Court in February 2011.[citation needed]

Simpson was sentenced on 5 December 2008. The judge ordered eight of the ten counts to run concurrently, with a maximum sentence of 33 years (until 2041) with parole possible after nine years in 2017 when Simpson became eligible at age 70. Simpson was incarcerated in the Lovelock Correctional Center until 1 October 2017, when he was released.[39][40]

Audio tape [ edit ]

An audio tape recorded by Riccio, which was later sold to TMZ.com, was central to the trial and conviction. FBI audio examiner Kenneth Marr testified that he was not able to determine whether or not the files were altered. He said he found areas of over-recording on the device that he said ""might"" mean the audio files had been manipulated. Alfred Beardsley stated that he told District Attorney David Roger and another official that the audio had been doctored. ""There's a whole section (missing) … and I talked to you directly about that"".[15]

Motion for retrial [ edit ]

Simpson, represented by attorney Patricia Palm, filed a motion for retrial.[41] In May 2013, the motion was heard; the week-long hearing included testimony from witnesses and Simpson. Simpson was represented at the hearing by Palm, who was joined by attorneys Ozzie Fumo and Thomas Pitaro.[42] Simpson's main argument was ineffective assistance of counsel. Simpson alleged his counsel Yale Galanter did not tell him about alleged plea-bargain offers that would have resulted in substantially shorter sentences. Grasso testified that it was Galanter's decision not to have Simpson testify.[43]

On May 17, 2013, Yale Galanter testified. He stated that Simpson had confided to him that guns were brought to the hotel room, and admitted to Galanter that he messed up in doing that.[44] Galanter made this statement after he was reminded that Simpson had waived attorney-client privilege, enabling his former attorney to testify.[44] Galanter was photographed by the Associated Press laughing about Simpson's arguments on the witness stand.[44]

Galanter confirmed that the night before the robbery he was dining at a restaurant with Simpson and a group of people. Galanter testified that Simpson casually mentioned his intent to retrieve ""his stuff,"" in what Simpson called a ""sting."" Galanter testified that he asked Simpson, ""What are you doing?"" and advised against it, telling Simpson ""to call the police."" Galanter testified: ""Mr. Simpson never told me he was going to go to the Palace (Station) hotel with a bunch of thugs, kidnap people and take property by force. To insinuate I, as a lawyer and officer of the court, would have blessed it is insane.""[45] Galanter did accept that Simpson's conviction was Galanter's responsibility.

In regard to plea offers, Galanter testified his practice is to always communicate plea offers to the client. He denied that Simpson did not know about plea offers. Galanter testified that during the trial he informed Simpson that prosecutors were offering a plea with 2–5 years of prison time. Simpson instructed Galanter to go back to the DA with a counter-offer of one year, which the DA immediately refused; the trial proceeded with no further offers or counters.[45]

365,"Which Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Have Reached Out to Departing Eden Sassoon? - The Real Housewives Gone but not forgotten?

Eden Sassoon may have gotten her walking papers, but the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star says she’s at peace with it.

“I get a call…Great conversation. And at the end of it, I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m alive,'” she told E!. “I’m alive again. I feel free and this end to that chapter, just a moment of time in my life, but a pretty big one because a lot of emotional stuff I worked through, is going to open the most beautiful things to come. And I wanted to tell people before people found out from different sources. And that was my way of sharing, you know, really, truly, an end is a new beginning, and anything’s possible now.”

While it’s only been a short time since her departure was announced, Eden says she’s talked to a few of her RHOBH co-stars since the news broke. And believe you’ll be shocked at the names Eden drops!

“Kyle and I spoke this morning through text and respect, respect for her to reach out and say the things and really say all the things she did. And you know? There’s an untapped friendship there someplace deep because it was interesting between her and I. And I think we understand one another in a lot of ways. And Rinna and I, I reached out to her just kind of thanking her for the beautiful journey I had gone on with her.”

I’m so happy to see Eden go. Nothing against her personally – I think she’s a cool person she’s just not a good fit for reality TV. It was clear that Eden was vying to be part of the season 8 cast, but her efforts failed miserably. Too little too late. I’m hoping that Bravo finds a better fit for season 8 and brings on actual “friends” of the Housewives.

Do you believe Eden is at peace with being fired from RHOBH? Was Eden hoping to be part of season 8? Are you surprised that Kyle and Rinna reached out to Eden? Will you miss Eden on RHOBH?

368,"10 Things You Absolutely Need to Know Before Getting a Spray Tan Warmer weather means less clothing, which means more skin on display—and for some people, that means a healthy tan is in order so as to avoid shining like a pale beacon when exposed to the light of day. But it’s 2017, folks, and we all know that baking our skin for real is out and a fake tan is in—and we’ve go plenty of spray tan tips.

There are a few other means of getting some color—easy at-home self-tanner, for one—which can be effective but runs the risk of turning your skin (and sheets) orange. Spray tanning is definitely where it is at.

Here, ten spray tan tips you must know before you hop in that spray tan booth. (Number 11 goes unsaid, but for the love of god, don’t forget to put on the goggles.)

Spray tans last about a week, give or take



This can vary from person to person, but they typically last about 5-7 days from one application.

Shower and exfoliate before you tan



Use a body scrub head to toe to slough away any dry, flaky skin before you get a spray tan so that the pigment will adhere smoothly for the most even results (as in, least streaky).

The color won’t just wash off



The pigment that spray tans leave behind is meant to slowly fade as your top layer of skin regenerates, so it’s not the kind of thing you can just scrub off. That’s why it’s able to last up to a week—and why you should approach with caution to make sure you won’t be stuck looking unnaturally tan for a full seven days.

Apply lotion every day



Keeping your newly tanned skin hydrated is the best way to make the color last longer, because it won’t dry out and need to be exfoliated prematurely.

It’ll get darker after application



Similarly to standard self-tanner, spray tans will get darker from the time they’re applied and as the day progresses. The color takes a little while to fully develop, so don’t be alarmed if you leave feeling like it’s too light—it won’t be for long.

Pat, don’t rub, your skin dry



To preserve your tan, pat yourself dry rather than scour with a towel after getting out of the shower. The idea is to not exfoliate for as long as possible so that you don’t slough off the tan. Avoid using loofahs or coarse washcloths for the same reason.

Wear nail polish



Even if it’s nothing more than a clear coat, wearing polish into the booth will help to protect your nails from the spray tan. If you do have a full manicure, don’t worry about it getting ruined—your nails will be wiped off afterwards.

Think about your bathing suit



While many people decide to get a spray tan while wearing nothing (no tan lines!), if you do wear a bathing suit, wear an old one you don’t mind ruining, since the tan can stain the fabric.

Apply barrier cream



Naturally drier areas of the skin, like the elbows, ankles, and knees, will absorb more pigment, so always apply a protective barrier cream before the tan so that they don’t go too dark. Most spray tan salons will provide the cream for use, so make sure you don’t skip it.

Look for a discount deal



Spray tanning can be expensive, but plenty of salons will offer deals on sites like Groupon and LivingSocial—if you’re apprehensive about the process but still want to give it a shot, at least make sure you’re not paying out the nose for your first time.

372,"Justin Timberlake Announces New Album ‘Man of the Woods’ As expected, Justin Timberlake announced a new album entitled “Man of the Woods” and a new single coming Friday via a minute-long video posted on his social media accounts. The album is due Feb. 2 — two days before his halftime performance on the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.

“This album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I’ve ever written, where I’m from — it’s personal,” he says in the video, which is filled with shots of Timberlake in outdoors settings. In other shots he is seen working with Pharrell Williams, who says “It feels so earthy, it’s just where you are in your life right now,” before adding emphatically, “That is a smash,” presumably about a song. Snippets of two or three new songs play in the background during the video.

While the wintery scenes contrast with Timberlake’s upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, he has been saying for some months that the album, on which he also worked with longtime collaborators Max Martin and Shellback (with whom he collaborated on his last single, the hit “Can’t Stop the Feeling” from the movie “Trolls”) and Timbaland, reflected his roots, calling it “Southern American music.”

Timberlake’s halftime performance during the Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 4 at Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium. Variety reported that he was the frontrunner on Sept. 27.",1
373,"Scheana Marie Gets Candid About Her Past Relationships: ""I Wasn't Really Being My True Self"" If Scheana Marie's romantic past was a carnival ride, it would be more of a roller coaster than a glide through the tunnel of love. The Vanderpump Rules pal's marriage to Mike Shay ended in divorce; shortly thereafter, her romantic relationship with longtime friend Rob Valletta was also put on ice. If breaking up is hard to do, then breaking up twice is even harder — and Scheana recently opened up about that in a major way.

Speaking to Us Weekly, the SURver admitted that she cringes at certain scenes from Vanderpump Rules Season 6. (Hint: She talked about Rob. A lot. Peep the clip above if you need proof.) ""Just seeing where I was last year and how I obsessed I was with my relationship and all of that and coming into this year, I feel like I’m much more self-aware, self-deprecating, and I feel like I’m me again for the first time in a while… I kind of lost myself for a couple years and got caught up in the things that weren’t important,"" she shared.

Scheana also reflected on prior seasons, which showcased the tough spots in her marriage. ""I think season 4, it got really hard just dealing with Shay’s addiction and martial problems and season 5, pretending like everything was fine. I felt like I wasn’t really being my true self, I was putting on this facade of ‘everything’s sunshine and rainbows and no, no, no, I’m really happy,"" she shared.



Sheana added, ""Even with Rob, there was so many times that things didn’t really [seem] right, but I ignored it. I ignored signs, I ignored other opinions. I was just like ‘No, no, no, this is perfect,’ because I couldn’t admit that me jumping into a relationship a month after a divorce was a bad idea. I couldn’t admit that things weren’t perfect. I just wanted everyone to think, ‘Oh wow, this is her fairy-tale ending, she got divorced and met the love of her life. And everyone lived happily ever after.’ And that was not the case.""

But the SURver has different plans for Season 7 (premieres Dec. 3 9/8 c.) ""I think this year, I’ve done a really good job at being as honest as I possibly can be and vulnerable. If I’m sad, you’re going to see me cry. If I’m angry, you’re going to hear what I have to say,” she said. “I think I held back for a long time and kind of tiptoed around certain people. I didn’t want to upset people. I wanted everyone to think that my life was perfect when it certainly wasn’t.""

She's also focusing more on her friendships. “That’s one thing I think Stassi, Kristen, and Katie love about me is they’re like, ‘We can make fun of you and you’re not going to get your feelings hurt now?'… I think that will be fun to see me not getting so butthurt about things that don’t matter.""

374,"Meet The Crown’s New Prince Philip The Crown has found its new Prince Philip, Netflix confirmed to Vanity Fair on Wednesday.

Tobias Menzies, best known for playing Edmure Tully on Game of Thrones and both Frank Randall and Black Jack Randall on Outlander, will pick up where Matt Smith left off, playing the real-life royal in the show’s third and fourth seasons.

The casting comes two months after Paul Bettany bowed out of consideration for the part because of the time commitment required to film the sweeping period drama in the U.K.

In a conversation with Vanity Fair last month, The Crown’s casting director Nina Gold explained why casting the period drama’s third season—which jumps forward about 10 years—was especially challenging.

“Not only are we casting real-life characters,” explained Gold, who also cast Tully on Game of Thrones, “but as we get closer to the present day, many of these people are very much alive. So we have to honor them by picking the right actor to play them—while making a link between the actors who played these characters in the first seasons.”

Earlier this week, Menzies hinted that he was not sure whether he would be returning to Game of Thrones, telling Digital Spy that his character is “obviously somewhere in a prison, he’s still around alive somewhere . . . I feel like they have so many stories to tie up, whether that’s a story they’ll want to go back to, I don’t know.”

On Wednesday, Menzies’s Outlander co-star Caitriona Balfe celebrated the casting by tweeting the initial report along with the message, “Congratulations darling. So excited for you and so excited to see this!!!”

Last fall, The Crown cast Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II. Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth during the drama’s first two seasons, has joked that audiences will quickly forget about the original cast.

“You’ll forget all about me and the rest of the cast,” she quipped in December. “You’ll be like, ‘Who are they?’ We’re the warm-up act.”

Deadline reported that Menzies “signed on for the next two seasons, and begins shooting this summer in the U.K.”

The Crown’s third season will pick up in the 1970s and introduce Camilla Parker Bowles, then Camilla Shand, who met Prince Charles at a polo match in 1971. While little else is known about The Crown’s new season, Nina Gold teased that Philip and Elizabeth’s eldest children, Charles and Anne, will have larger roles than they did in the initial seasons.

“Charles, Camilla, and Anne are going to be pretty interesting characters to follow, because they are just coming into their own,” said Gold. “We’ve cast a pretty wide net for these new young characters.”

375,"Rose Leslie Flashes Engagement Ring From Kit Harington Game on! Kit Harington announced his engagement to his Game of Thrones costar Rose Leslie on September 27, and now we get to see her engagement ring. The 30-year-old actress was spotted at London’s Heathrow airport looking fresh faced with a big diamond on her ring finger.

The couple has HBO to thank for their relationship. They began dating in 2012 after first meeting on set and playing love interests until (spoiler alert!) Rose’s character, Ygritte, was killed off. Kit, who plays Jon Snow, alluded to a forever future with Rose earlier this year. ”Ygritte is the only woman for Jon. Always,” he exclusively told Us Weekly in July. “There will be no one else.” It’s a sentiment his character does not seem to share, having gotten together with Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys this past season!

Winter Is Here and So Are These ‘Game of Thrones’ Inspired Beauty Products

The couple first hit the red carpet together at the Oliver Awards in London in April 2016, where Rose rocked a red Christian Dior tulle gown from their Spring 2017 collection. The twosome formally announced their engagement in The Times’ “Forthcoming Marriages” section.

“Mr. K.C. Harington and Miss R.E. Leslie,” the post read. “The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire.”

Kit revealed that he actually proposed earlier than he planned to. “I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff…” he told British TV host Jonathan Ross. “But we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine, and I blew my load early.”

“Sorry, that’s a really bad expression!” he quickly added. “I was meant to do it the day after with the lights. What I meant to say was, I popped my question a bit early. Not blew my load.”

376,"Walmart apologizes for N-word found in product description Walmart has removed an item from its website and issued an apology on Monday after the product description was found to contain the N-word.

The merchandise, a weaving net used for hair extensions retailed under the brand Jagazi Naturals, was being sold by a third party on Walmart.com for $7.28.

The title of the item read, in part: 'Durable Stretchy Weaving Net Weaving Cap Wig Cap Size M (N*****-brown).'

Scroll down for video

Twitter user Kwani Lunis came upon this offensive product description for a weaving cap on Walmart's website

The racist term also caught the attention of comedy writer Travon Free, who quipped that he and Walmart should 'have a chat'

The offensive term was also repeated in the description section beneath a photo showing a mannequin with the brown, lacy cap on its head.

Online user Kwani Lunis came upon the racial slur online and alerted Walmart, tweeting: 'Hey @Walmart what are you doing.'

Comedian Travon Free, who is African-American and works as a staff writer on TBS' Full Frontal with Samanta Bee, weighed in on the controversy, quipping in a tweet that he and Walmart should 'have a chat.'

By Monday, as outrage over the slur spread on social media, the weave cap had been removed and the big-box retailer apologized on its Tweeter account, writing: ‘We agree, this is appalling.’

The company also issued a statement laying the blame on the third-party retailer.

Writer and commentator Roxane Gay also weighed in on the controversy on Twitter

So sorry: Walmart later removed the item from its website and issued an apology

‘We are very sorry and appalled that third party seller listed their item with this description on our online marketplace. It is a clear violation of our policy and has been removed, and we are investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.’

By late afternoon, the weaving net was still available for purchase in black on Walmart’s website.

Meanwhile, Jagazi Naturals, a company based out of London and run by CEO Chizo Onuh, who is originally from Nigeria, posted a statement on its website addressing the flap over the wig cap and claiming that someone had hijacked their brand to hawk a fake version of their weave net.

'We woke up this morning to the news that someone has used our name JAGAZI to list an item,' the message read. 'Please beware that we are reporting this to as many people as we can and trying to get all the listings pulled down.

'The real JAGAZI is a 100% black company for black people. People have often used our brand name to try and sell their fake products. Please be aware. Very sorry for all the distress this has caused. We are feeling the pain here as well. Most shocking!'

The weaving net controversy comes just days after Walmart Canada came under fire and was forced to pull from its shelves a 'racist' onesie decorated with teepees that joked about children living at home despite the country's history of taking indigenous kids away from their families.",1

“What’s that worth, really? Yeah, for me, I’ve overcome a lot of challenges. I started to think that I couldn’t count on my self and that I needed all this outside help to stay healthy. The inspiration of doing this has healed me more than any doctor, any supplement—anything. So that’s a really profound life moment. That’s what I take away.”

Debbie and Alan were the second pair to get eliminated from the 25th season of the show. They followed Shark Tank‘s Barbara Corcoran and Keo Motsepe.

In addition to her role as a glamorous red carpet fixture, Amal balances being a mom to twins, Alexander and Ella, with her job as an ultra successful human rights attorney. And it seems as if the short time away from her career will come to an end sooner rather than later.

The human rights attorney, who gave birth back in June, plans to return to work as soon as this week, according to E! News. ""Amal Clooney is heading back to work this week,"" a source revealed to the news outlet, noting that the mom of two only has a meeting on her agenda thus far, as she intends to ""go back slowly"".

And though her star power is otherworldly, Clooney is conflicted about her reentry into the working world, just like any other working mom. ""She has mixed emotions about going back,"" another source said. ""She has loved every minute of the summer with the twins and will miss them immensely, but she is also is looking forward to resuming her career work and getting back to it.""

380,"Taylor Swift's 2017: The Timeline From the record-breaking 'Reputation' to speaking out against sexual assault, Swift continued to change culture in 2017.

Taylor Swift didn't do a lot in 2017... until she did. Following months spent attempting to fly under the radar, and the Instagram blackout of Aug. 2017, Swift took the rest of the year by storm, with a not-so-traditional album rollout for Reputation and a series of larger than life visuals to accompany the first singles.

Fans got a sneak preview at what was to come from her personally curated Secret Sessions, but those were hidden away from the lens of the media. Now that Reputation is here to stay, Billboard has taken a look back at Swift's action packed year.

Jan. 27 - “I Don’t Want to Live Forever” music video release

Swift kicked off the New Year with the release of the visuals to Fifty Shades Darker track “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever.” Swift and former 1D artist Zayn trashed a hotel room for the video, lit by flashing shades of blue and red. The song peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Feb. 4 2017 - Taylor Swift plays “only show of 2017”

Swift broke some disappointing news to fans during her pre-Super Bowl set for DIRECTV Now Super Saturday Night. ""I have to be really honest with you about something: As far as I know, I'm doing one show in 2017. And as far as I know, this is that one show,"" Swift said long before the announcement of Reputation. She added, “You're the crowd in my most recent daydreams, when I'm thinking about being onstage, so I was wondering: If you don't feel like dancing for yourself or screaming for yourself, you don't feel in the mood or whatever, you're like stressed out, would you do it for me tonight?""

Feb. 15-16 - TAS Rights Management, LLC filed nine separate trademarks for “Swifties”

Swift’s brand nailed down the things most true to her: Swifties. Nine separate trademarks were filed for the word alone, including one involving “a website featuring non-downloadable audio recordings [and] video recordings.” The idea that Swift would launch her own streaming service was debunked.

Mar. 2 - Ed Sheeran teases Swift’s upcoming album

The singer revealed that his pal would be putting her music out quite late on in the year, saying, “Taylor [Swift] isn’t going to be releasing until probably the end of this year—Christmas is the smartest time to release because that’s when everyone buys records.” Looks like he was right.

Mar. 10 - Man arrested for stalking/burglary inside Swift’s apartment building

A man was arrested in Swift’s New York City building on charges of burglary, stalking, and trespassing. According to a Page Six report, the man allegedly hoped to meet the singer face-to-face. While the man was initially held on $20,000 bail, he was found unfit to stand trial and reportedly “placed in the custody of the New York State Office of Mental Health” as of late September.

April 4 - “Busy working” on new album in Nashville

After the singer had been spotted driving around Nashville, a source confirmed to ET that she’d come “to get away from the paparazzi,” and also that she had “been busy working on her upcoming album.”

May 15 - She’s really in Nashville! Swift celebrates Mother’s Day at home with her mom

TMZ did the heavy digging and proved that Swift really had been in Nashville - though she may have been hopping back and forth, as she was spotted getting onto her private jet after a spending the weekend with mama Swift for Mother’s Day.

July 4 - Keeping it low-key for the first time in years on the Fourth of July

Paparazzi were very upset that Swift didn’t have an Independence day blowout tailor-made for media, even though she'd been keeping a relatively low profile all year.

Aug. 14 - $1 Countersuit Win

The long-drawn-out legal battle between DJ David Mueller, who was accused of reaching under the pop star’s skirt to grope her during a photo shoot in 2013, was finally put to rest. After Mueller attempted to countersue for damages that occurred following Swift’s accusation (which was quietly made to the station, who promptly let him go), the singer was awarded a single symbolic dollar in damages. Swift’s attorney Douglas Baldridge explained the value, “It means no means no, and it tells every woman that they will determine what is tolerated with their body.""

Aug. 18-20 - Bye bye, old Taylor… and old posts

In the internet-breaking fashion Swift seems to have perfected, the singer’s social media accounts went into full blackout mode. No old posts were to be found anywhere, signaling that she was gearing up to launch something huge.

Aug. 21 - She’s back, but only with some snakes

In one of the best social media moments of the year, Swift posted a three-part series of glitch-y snake videos without captions to her Instagram to break her short-lived blackout. The image of the snake had become synonymous with Swift’s internet-meme identity, following the drawn-out beef with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West regarding West’s “Famous” lyrics and video.

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 23, 2017 at 7:01am PDT

Aug. 23 - It’s an album!

After five days (AKA an eternity in Swiftie time), Swift revealed the project behind the social media madness. Continuing in the three-part posting style, Swift announced “FIRST SINGLE OUT TOMORROW NIGHT,” posted the cover art, and announced the release date for then-upcoming album Reputation. All posts were still caption-less.

Aug. 24 - Look what you made her do.

Swift released Reputation’s lead single “Look What You Made Me Do” with a clever caption on Instagram: “..ready for it? New single #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo out now.” Of course, the forthcoming track title remained an inside joke to the singer’s team upon posting time.

Aug. 27 - Look what you made her do, part two.

The singer premiered the visuals for “LWYMMD” at the 2017 MTV VMAs, snagging 43.2 million views in the first 24 hours alone, now standing with over 783 million views. The Joseph Kahn-directed visual is loaded with references to the “old Taylor,” including a tombstone for Nils Sjoberg, her songwriting pseudonym on ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’ 2016 hit “This Is What You Came For,” nearly all of her most iconic outfits, more snakes, and nearly all her besties’ names scribbled on a new version of her “You Belong With Me” music video costume.

Sept. 3 - “…Ready for It?” released

Swift released the second track off Reputation after she previewed it on Saturday Night Football the night prior. It followed suit with the darker, much more dramatic new Taylor, yet gave no clearer picture of what was yet to come.

Sept. 5 - No. 1, again

Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"" tops the Billboard Hot 100, where it would reign for three weeks. The song was her fifth Hot 100 No. 1 and broke the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman; it also stopped the record-tying 16-week reign of ""Despacito.""

Sept. 7 - TayTay On Demand

Ever wanted to know what Swift is up to at any given moment? Well this isn’t exactly that, but the trailer jokes that it will be. Swift announced her new video-on-demand channel in partnership with AT&T and DirectTV called Taylor Swift NOW, accompanied by a hilarious play-by-play of Swift’s day in the studio (complete with Andy Samberg cameo).

Oct. 11 - The Swift Life app announced

Stans will finally have a one-stop-shop for finding out everything there is to know about their fave singer. It is said to function as a social network of sorts, leaning into Swift’s hobby of “lurking” and replying to fans on social media, and also offering an opportunity to “collect Taymojis, stickers, pics, and more.”

Oct. 20 - “Gorgeous” released

The predictable yet addicting pop track the world was waiting for finally arrived. Swift sang of a romantic interest that was somehow too gorgeous for even a superstar like her to talk to. James Reynolds, two-year-old daughter of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, was later officially credited in album liner notes as the voice at the beginning of the track.

Oct. 27 - “…Ready for it?” returns with visuals

The fans surely weren’t ready for it, yet with the Joseph Kahn directed video packed with hidden messages, it wasn’t long before Swifties decoded them all. Among the most obvious are Swift’s birth year spray-painted on a wall, the Chinese characters for “Year of the Snake,” as well as a similar lightning strike in the intro to Calvin Harris’ “This is What You Came For” album art.

Nov. 2 - “Call It What You Want” lyric video released

Fans started to get a fuller picture of what was coming from Reputation in just over a week. Swift seemed to be finding her way to happiness in the first ballad to be released from the album, but she was still attempting to rid herself of the drama she’d endured. The day was special for more than one reason, coinciding with the 13th anniversary (Swift’s lucky number) of meeting Scott Borchetta, the Big Machine Records executive who signed her and gave her the fateful big break.

Nov. 7 - Track list revealed on Swift’s Instagram Account

Three days prior to the Reputation release date, Swift posted the back cover to the album, featuring the track listing.

3 days until #reputation A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 7, 2017 at 6:52pm PST

Nov. 8 - CMA Win

Even though she's left country in the dust on her own albums, Swift's song for Little Big Town, ""Better Man,"" nabbed song of the year at the 2017 CMAs.

Nov. 9 - The album was leaked, and this is why we can’t have nice things

In this day and age, so many albums leak prior to release date, but not quite in this fashion: missing from the leaked files was track no. 13, “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things.” Whether it was at the hands of Swift’s team, Swift herself, or a sneaky fan, it was quite the clever move.

On the same day, an intimate recording “New Years Day” from what looks like a secret session was premiered on ABC during an episode of Scandal.

Nov. 10 - Reputation is out everywhere, except for streaming services

Reputation hit shelves and online retailers; a Target exclusive version included a magazine with poems and photos from Swift. She announced 20 days later that Reputation would be available to stream at midnight on Dec. 1.

Nov. 11 - SNL

Swift plays Saturday Night Live, busting out ""...Ready for It?"" and an acoustic ""Call It What You Want.""

Nov. 13 - Tonight Show

Following the death of Jimmy Fallon's mother, Taylor Swift agreed to appear on The Tonight Show to play a moving version of ""New Year's Day.""

Nov. 20 - Reputation Is No. 1

Swift's Reputation becomes her fifth No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. Reputation notched 2017’s biggest week for an album, as the set earned 1.238 million equivalent album units in the week ending Nov. 16, according to Nielsen Music. Of that sum, 1.216 million were in traditional album sales -- the largest sales frame for an album since 2015. It would hold the No. 1 spot for three weeks.

Nov. 28 - Grammy Time

The Taylor Swift-penned ""Better Man"" from Little Big Town is nominated for best country song -- which is a songwriter(s) award, so Swift will get a trophy if it wins. She's also nominated for best song written for visual media for her Zayn collab ""I Don't Want to Live Forever.""

Dec. 1 - Taylors In the Stream

Reputation appears on the major streaming services.

Dec. 4 2017 - Reputation, but make it fashion (UK Vogue cover)

Vogue UK revealed its first cover of the new year would feature Swift. Newly appointed Editor in Chief Edward Enninful styled the singer during his second cover after taking the reigns from Alexandra Shulman. Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, also photographers for all Reputation visuals, shot the twelve-page spread. Two days later, the high fashion mag revealed a poem Swift wrote exclusively to run with the feature, titled, ""The Trick to Holding On.""

Dec. 6 2017 - Swift is one of Time’s “Silence Breakers”

Her summer court case was not meant to be a media spectacle, but it was meant to prove a point with the symbolic $1 request. As Time gave the platform to “The Silence Breakers,” women who helped bring sexual assault and harassment to the forefront of the national conversation, as its 2017 Person of the Year, Swift was among the individuals highlighted. The Time interview is the first time Swift has done press about the court case, and in it she detailed reaching out to Kesha for support, as well as her feelings as she sat in the courtroom. ""I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened,” Swift said. “This man hadn’t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn’t hold back on my mom -- why should I be polite? I’m told it was the most amount of times the word 'ass' has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.""

Kardashian West and husband Kanye West had a changing table made for baby Chicago, whose nursery decor fits right in with the rest of their home’s aesthetic of “light colors and woods and soft and natural colors.”

And there’s one other (comfortable and practical) piece of nursery furniture the new mom of three cherishes greatly: her glider.

“I have a glider with an ottoman for feeding,” she told Architectural Digest. “With the first baby, I had a rocking chair, and I just love a glider so much more — you can move easier.”",1

And the tweets kept coming. So why exactly are fans so obsessed with this particular pair? Because for as long as we’ve been watching them on TV, it seemed like they were doomed to fail.

The couple met on season 2 of BIP in 2015 — and as viewers are well aware, it was pretty much love at first sight for Iaconetti. But while they went on dates (even an overnight one!), Haibon wasn’t quite as enamored.

The result? A seemingly endless flow of tears from Iaconetti, who developed a reputation for sobbing in confessionals over her unrequited love.

Nevertheless, the two remained friends even after things didn’t work out — and viewers could hardly believe their eyes when they learned that the pair would both return for season 3 of BIP the following year. But if you thought things would be different this time, think again.

For yet another summer, fans watched Iaconetti pine over Haibon, unapologetically sabotaging his chances with fellow contestant Caila Quinn. But still, Haibon resisted Iaconetti’s advances, and it seemed all but obvious that these two would never work out.

Finally, Iaconetti decided it was time to move on. In late 2017, she jetted off to film another ABC spinoff, The Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt. The two started dating — just as Haibon had begun to realize that maybe what he was looking for had been in front of him all along.

The giddy duo recapped their journey for fans in a tear-filled episode of Iaconetti’s show The Story of Us, and Haibon admitted Iaconetti’s new relationship felt like “a kick in the a—.”

“I remember I heard rumors that she might have met somebody, and I was sad,” he said. “Sometimes I need a kick in the a—. That was a big kick in the a—.”

After production on Winter Games wrapped, Haibon and Iaconetti reunited for a formerly planned vacation to St. Lucia with Iaconetti’s sister Lauren and Bachelor alums Tanner Tolbert and Jade Roper in January.

“Going into St. Lucia, I did a lot of self-reflection … trying to figure out what I want, what I should do, if I should do anything,” Haibon said of weighing whether or not to tell Iaconetti about his feelings for her. “It’s so unfair for me to say anything. Ashley goes on a show, finds another guy and now I’m gonna say something? What kind of a—hole does that?”

Eventually, however, he decided to come clean — and took a page right out of a romantic comedy when he planted a kiss on Iaconetti just as she was about to board her flight home.

But even after sharing a romantic smooch at the airport, Iaconetti wanted to give her relationship with Wendt a fair shot.

“I thought ‘Okay, well that’s everything I’ve ever wanted, but I’m definitely gonna continue dating this other guy,’ ” she said. “I do like him. He’s pursued me … he’s been all in the entire time and I deserve to pursue somebody else and for somebody else to pursue me after all this time.”

As Winter Games was airing, however, Iaconetti knew her relationship with Wendt was over, and she called it quits in early March.

“I just knew in my heart at that point that it wasn’t right with Kevin,” she said. “I ended the relationship because it had run its course — and then Jared was still there.”

And the rest is history. Looks like fairytales do come true, after all!",1

385,"Watch Nicki Minaj Bring Out Lil Wayne, David Guetta & Jason Derulo For a Four-Song Medley to Open 2017 Billboard Music Awards Nicki Minaj certainly knows how to create a moment. The multi-talented MC opened the 2017 Billboard Music Awards with a bang, bringing out high-profile guests Lil Wayne (""No Frauds""), David Guetta (""Light My Body Up"") and Jason Derulo (""Swalla"") for a four-song medley that concluded with a solo run through her recent single ""Regret In Your Tears.""

After an introduction that included snippets of previous hits like ""Beez in the Trap,"" ""Starships"" and ""Moment For Life,"" Minaj ripped into a forceful rendition of her much-discussed Remy Ma diss track ""No Frauds,"" with Weezy on hand to run through his verse. Drake, who is also featured on the song, did not appear (though he watched from the crowd), but Minaj had plenty more guests to come, moving seamlessly into ""Light My Body Up"" with Guetta manning the boards behind her.

Derulo then emerged, sporting long dreads and a chain over an all-black ensemble, to kick into ""Swalla."" Minaj, seductive and sexy as always, delivered her verse while gyrating in a chair, but she still had more to come. ""Regret In Your Tears,"" another cut she released in a trilogy earlier this year that also included ""Frauds"" and the Wayne-assisted ""Changed It,"" rounded out her four-song medley and saw the MC rapping-singing while rising on a pedestal, putting an exclamation point on the superstar-charged opener.

Minaj is nominated for the Billboard Chart Achievement Award Presented by Xfinity, alongside Luke Bryan, The Chainsmokers, The Weeknd and Twenty One Pilots. She's had a busy 2017 already; in addition to the songs she performed to open the show, all of which have been released this year, she's also released the song ""Changed It"" with Wayne, as well as tracks alongside Gucci Mane (""Make Love""), Major Lazer (""Run Up""), DNCE (""Kissing Strangers"") and Katy Perry (""Swish Swish""), with an album thought to be on the way this year.

And in March, Nicki earned herself a piece of history when she passed the legendary Aretha Franklin for most Hot 100 appearances among women in the history of the chart with 76. Franklin (73), Taylor Swift (70), Rihanna (58) and Madonna (57) round out the top five. Check out Minaj's star-studded medley above.",1
386,"Tori Spelling Returns to Social Media Following Alleged Breakdown Tori Spelling returned to social media on Friday to wish her baby boy, Beau, a happy 1st birthday.

In the celebratory post, Spelling can be heard saying, ""Who's one today?"" as her husband, Dean McDermott, says in the background, ""Hey buddy, happy birthday.""

""#BeauBeau1 Happy 1st Birthday! Did he just say Beau or Birthday? Ha ha... Daddy @imdeanmcdermott and I ❤️👶🏼You SO much!!"" the former Beverly Hills, 90210 star captioned the clip.

The video comes after ET confirmed that police were called to the 44-year-old actress's family home in Woodland Hills, California, on Thursday, responding to a disturbance call earlier in the day.

McDermott also shared an equally adorable video of him singing happy birthday to his son.

He captioned the post, ""Time flys!!! This little dude is 1 today!!!! Happy Birthday Beau Dean McDermott!! We love you!! #littlerockstar #firstbirthday.""

A source told ET earlier this week that Spelling had a meltdown at her home due to multiple stress factors that she's currently dealing with.

“There are several things that led up to this, and she really couldn't take the pressure any longer,” the source said of Spelling. “Tori tries to be the best mom she can be, but with five children and terrible financial issues, her marriage has suffered tremendously.”

According to the source, she and her husband have also been arguing over money and their five children. McDermott had left the house for a couple of days for a break, which is why when he came home on Wednesday night, Spelling thought there was a break-in.

An LAPD spokesperson confirmed to ET that there was a call for service of a burglary at Spelling's address on Wednesday night, but it was determined that there was no crime.

""She had no idea he had walked in the door and it scared her,"" the source said. “She is obsessed with trying to make her relationship with Dean work despite all their issues. Her breakdown came after she and Dean had been fighting. She literally was hysterical and, sadly, the kids were home and everyone was scared. ... She is under far too much pressure.""

390,"Kim Zolciak Slams RHOA Cast! Talks Feud with Kroy's Parents & Racist Claims Former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak is slamming her former castmates in an all new interview!

The Don’t Be Tardy star appeared on former RHOBH star Brandi Glanville‘s podcast – Brandi Glanville Unfiltered – on Friday, and dished on a number of topics including her children’s cursing, her daughter Brielle Biermann’s lack of ambition, her strained relationship with her parents and her husband Kroy Biermann’s parents, and most importantly, her return to RHOA this past season.

If you recall, Kim had an incredibly difficult time during this year’s RHOA reunion as pretty much every lady on the show was against her, with the exception of her pal Sheree Whitfield. In her interview, Kim described the reunion as “traumatizing” and vowed she will NEVER return to the series.

“It was horrible. It was disgusting,” said Kim about her return to RHOA for season 10. “The reunion was so f–king traumatizing. There was a complete attack. You only saw a few minutes [of me] from the reunion, but it was three and a half hours of me sitting on the couch to the point where I didn’t hear anything after about two hours. They were talking [about] my kids are so ugly. Kenya Moore was saying my kids are so ugly, they’re so stupid, and they’re not going anywhere.”

“She’s disgusting. She’s pretty nasty. She’s evil. Kenya’s not a good person. You don’t have a good heart,” continued Kim.

Host Brandi, who has also feuded with Kenya in the past during their time on Celebrity Apprentice, also got in on the Kenya bashing action! “She’s like the devil. She’s like Omarosa [Manigault]. I worked with both of them. It was hell,” shared Brandi.

Unfortunately for Kim, she also got a ton of public backlash after she was shown complaining to host Andy Cohen backstage at the reunion about some of her castmates referring to her as racist. During that convo, Kim made an odd comment when she told Andy that racism wasn’t really a real thing, and that it’s only making headlines nowadays due to social media. While she has since apologized for that comment, Kim made it clear that she is still upset over that convo, as she feels she was edited out of context.

“You don’t even get to see the 45 minutes in the bathroom [of what] really happened between Andy and I. I just think that they edited out of context a lot,” shared Kim. “When you don’t finish my statement, you make me look like somebody I’m not. It just puts a bad taste in my mouth. After being on this network for 11 years, it’s like you can’t tether on the line of racism in this day and age. It’s not funny. I don’t find it f–king funny. It’s gross.”

In addition to blaming RHOA producers for bad editing, she also blames her former co-stars for what she sees as playing the race card.

“They know damn well that I’m not racist,” said Kim about the RHOA cast. “So, to pull that f–king card is disgusting.”

She added, “I’ll never go back. I really envisioned it to be so different but there’s so much hatred in these girls’ hearts. It’s fun to banter back and forth and cut up and whatever, but this was downright f–king nasty, dirty.”

Kim then went on to reveal how some of the ladies requested that Kroy stop coming to cast events with her, adding that Kroy compared that reqeust to slavery.

“We got a phone call that Kroy could no longer drive me to scenes. Kroy said slavery ended a long time ago,” shared Kim. “We drink at these scenes so I’m not going to drink and f–king drive. They called and said he can no longer drive [you], two of the women have complained. Kroy said slavery ended a long time ago sweety.”

The topic turned to Kim’s strained relationship with her parents, who she hasn’t seen or spoken to in over six years, as she revealed they remain estranged.

“No,” answered Kim when asked if she talks to her mom. “And I’m okay with it though, like I wasn’t okay with it for so long. As a mother, if you mess with my kids and you start selling stories that aren’t true, and you affect my kids? [I’m done].”

She seems to be referencing an interview her parents did years ago, in which they confirmed that Kim’s eldest two daughters, Brielle and Ariana Biermann, don’t have the same father.

She was also asked about her estranged relationship with Kroy’s parents. They don’t have a relationship with Kroy as well since he married Kim. Oddly enough, Kim said she sort of understands why Kroy’s parents didn’t want their son to marry her.

“I don’t think they ever necessarily hated me but I just wasn’t their vision [for their son],” she shared. “I was 31, yes I have a bachelor’s degree in nursing, I went to college, but I had two kids. And I told Kroy that if I saw Housewives, like the chain-smoking, drinking wine, cursing like a sailor, I would be like ugh [as well].”

Additionally, Kim was asked about her kids cursing up a storm on the show, and she appeared to want to blame their big sister Brielle, 21, for being the bad influence.

“KJ, I mean what do you expect? He has a 21-yr-old sister at the end of the day,” said Kim. “But he’s so well behaved in school. He doesn’t say it around other people. He won a huge award at school for his behavior so the kids are just so great at school and then they come home. It’s more me. He would never say that in front of Kroy.”

On the topic of Brielle, Kim admitted that her daughter lacks motivation when asked what Brielle does these days, adding that Brielle’s main focus now is Instagram.

“Well, she wants to start on her own podcast actually, [but] she is so busy with Instagram,” admitted Kim. “It’s insane [how much money she’s making]. She does so well. She’s very authentic and very real. and only will post what she believes in but she’s not overly motivated. When you make that kind of money on Instagram though, it’s like you think I’m going to wait tables?”

She did add that Brielle is a great big sister, who actually spends nights at her home, in order to be closer to her young siblings, despite having her own place now.

“She has her own apartment but yeah, she’s at the house with me,” explained Kim. “She has a huge high rise [apartment] in Buckhead which is like Beverly Hills, you know. She has this beautiful apartment and she comes to our house every night and sleeps.”

“She uses [her apartment] on the weekends,” added Kroy, who was also present during the interview, although he barely said anything.

“She has younger siblings that she’s so connected with. She picks them up from school [and] she has lunch with them. She’s super involved,” continued Kim.

Finally, Kim was asked when viewers can expect to see the new season of Don’t Be Tardy.

“I don’t know. They said December. Usually, we’ve aired by now. I swear it’s coming,” answered Kim.

And the actor and his human rights lawyer wife Amal have roped in their parents to help with childcare, and enjoy the Italian sunshine, as the group were seen headed out for dinner this week.

Amal was seen jetting in by private jet with George's parents Nina and Nick Clooney, while her mother Baria Alamuddin flew on a separate flight, before the whole family reunited for a dinner the next evening.

Meanwhile the lawyer's mum Baria arrived by commercial flight later in the day.

The evening after, the whole family met up with George after a day of filming at popular restaurant Il Marino di Puntaldia.

Clooney is working hard in the region for his new project Catch 22, with the star directing, producing and starring in the six episode miniseries based on Joseph Heller's seminal novel.

It was announced in April that the multi-talented star was reducing his role in the Hulu production so he could concentrate on his directing and producing credits.

The two-time Oscar winner has hired Kyle Chandler of Friday Night Lights fame to take over the part of Col. Cathcart (played by Martin Balsam in the 1970 adaptation) originally earmarked for himself while he takes on the less demanding role of Scheisskopf.

""Lauren and Ben realized they were just two different people,"" the source says. ""They didn't have much in common and really had opposite interests. Ben was a quiet homebody and Lauren liked to go out and do things with friends. There are no bad feelings between them -- they just grew apart.""

Judging by her social media, Bushnell has been coping with the breakup just fine this summer, spending time with gal pals and getting her modeling career going after moving back to Los Angeles.

In May, Higgins broke his silence on their split in the first episode of his podcast with fellow Bachelor star Ashley Iaconetti, Ben and Ashley: ""Almost Famous,"" and had nothing but good things to say about his ex. Still, he acknowledged that their breakup had been ""a long time coming.""

""I think, mutually, Lauren and I saw that life was getting more difficult,"" he said. ""I would say the joy that we felt toward our relationship at the beginning was -- for some reason -- slipping away, and we were both working very hard to bring that joy back. And it just never seemed to get there. So, it was a long time coming, but it wasn't necessarily like we dragged it out.""

""I know that JoJo was told what had happened. I almost felt a little bit betrayed,"" she told People.

395,"'Outlander': Inside the Making of the Iconic Print Shop Reunion ""Most scripts we have a certain page count you want to stay around,"" executive producer Matthew B. Roberts tells THR. ""I didn't stick to a page count. I just let the reunion happen — where it ended is where it ended.""

[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the ""A. Malcolm"" episode of Starz's Outlander.]

Following a prolongued wait, Starz's Outlander finally delivered its big print shop reunion between Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire (Caitriona Balfe) on Sunday, delivering the most iconic moment from Diana Gabaldon's series in grand fashion.

The time-travel romance drama slowed from its usual breakneck pace to relish the moment its star-crossed lovers — separated after 20 years apart — finally reunited as the supersized episode brought the key scene from Voyager to life. From Jamie's fainting at the sight of his long-lost wife to meeting Mr. Willoughby (Gary Young) and Young Ian (John Bell) and the first time he slept with Claire after their long-awaited reunion, ""A. Malcolm"" played out almost exactly as it does in the book.

That isn't to say that there weren't some changes from the source material. Among them: when Jamie told Claire about his son Willie (Clark Butler) after she showed him photos of Brianna (Sophie Skelton). (That scene doesn't play out until much later in the book.)

To hear Outlander executive producer and ""A. Malcolm"" writer Matthew B. Roberts tell it, that deviation was the biggest challenge when it came to bringing the important moment to life.

""I wanted to stay as close to that median point of the source material as possible and not stray too far to either side of that,"" Roberts tells The Hollywood Reporter. ""I wanted to keep [things] as faithful to the source material as I could, from beginning to end, because of what has already come before this. We had debates in the writers room about what to keep and what to add and what adding something might do to the scene.""

Although he was reluctant to add in the Willie change, Roberts ultimately came around in the end. ""It took me a while to figure out how to make that work in the scheme of the scene,"" he says. ""That was a tough add.""

But as excited as viewers were for the heavily promoted episode, Roberts says he was ""torn"" about it actually airing. ""I'm both very excited that fans see it and I'm dreading that they see it,"" he says, lamenting the fact that the episode was ""built up"" too much for his liking. ""The wedding episode wasn't built up like this, it just kind of happened, and even 'Faith' in season two wasn't anticipated like this. For this one, there is quite a big build-up and I don't want people to be disappointed because of that.""

Roberts is quick to remind viewers who may feel disappointed in any changes that while they are making the best adaptation of the Outlander books as possible, they're not doing a word-for-word re-creation of Gabaldon's series. ""I always like to say that the book is the parent and the television show is the child,"" he says. ""We're doing an adaptation with the same DNA but it's a different, living, breathing creature.""

Below, Roberts talks with THR about what went into the making the most iconic episode of the series, why he waited three years to write ""A. Malcolm"" and more.

Did you actively request to write this episode or was it assigned to you?

I picked it. From when we were in the first season, writers were picking episodes, and I just said, ""I'll wait until this one."" I used my big pick for this one, because I knew once we officially got the pick up [for season three] that it was going to be the big episode and I wanted to give it a try. I was lucky enough to get, in the first season, the spanking episode and I knew that that was going to be a big one as well. That was assigned to me and I was really happy about it because I like to write the episodes when it's really focused on Jamie and Claire and their dynamics, their relationship. Writing battle scenes and sword fights aren't as exciting to write for this show as the Jamie and Claire scenes. Outlander is literally about Jamie and Claire, so those are the scenes I enjoy.

There have been major deviations from the book already this season, so did you set out to make any intentional changes in this episode?

No, this one, for me, was really the one to stay faithful. The way we planned it within the season, we always knew we were going to take a pause. Most episodes have a lot of plot in them to take you through the story. We have 900 pages of book and only 13 episodes, so you have to keep it plotted out with drive for each episode. This particular one we decided to take a step back, take a breather, so to speak, and let the characters get to know each other again. However long that takes, that's how long it takes. I just let the reunion happen. We rehearsed this episode more than any other, so we did give a lot of time and effort to make this special, especially for the actors, because they hadn't really spent a lot of time together over the first half of this season. They were in separate scenes almost the whole time until now.

So this was their reunion offscreen, too? That certainly adds some extra authenticity to it.

Yes. Cait and Sam are really great together, but they just didn't have time onscreen together for the first half. So we rehearsed quite a bit and gave it a couple extra days for filming, too.

Did you know from the start that the episode would be supersized?

We told Starz that this should be a luxurious episode, one that we let breathe and don't rush through the scenes, don't pace things up, just let it be what it is. So we did, and that's why it came out to 74 minutes.

How did you decide where to end the episode, with Claire getting attacked by a mysterious man in the brothel after Jamie left?

It was originally going to end a little bit later where Claire walks into that room and the man, that fight was going to go a little bit farther. We decided to trim the edges off of that and just have it end as more of a cliffhanger. To carry that on further actually diminished the reunion. It started to become another story, and we didn't want that. With the man there, we let that story start in the next episode.

The credit sequence for this episode with the names shown on printed pages is beautiful. How did you decide on that method?

I am lucky enough to have been tasked with those episodic title cards, and the printing presses we use on the show actually work. They are practical printing presses. So when I saw one for the first time, I got the idea of incorporating showing how printing works to do the title cards like that. The benefit was I wrote this episode, so I have the printed title card from this episode framed and hanging in my office.

The episode feels like a follow-up to the wedding installment from season one, especially with the focus on Jamie and Claire's ""first"" love scenes. Was it your intention to make this a sequel for the wedding episode?

I wasn't even thinking about that in the sense of redoing it or paying homage to it. This had to be different. We talked about this with everybody [in the writers room]: How would you feel going back after 20 years and seeing someone you were deeply in love with? This had to feel new and clumsy. There's the initial anticipation for the audience and characters. Claire was anticipating this for a few weeks, and that's why we did the reset.

Starting the episode with Jamie's point of view a few hours before Claire arrives was a bit of a tease for viewers, considering where the last episode left off.

That was something we planned to do [different from the book]. In the book, sometimes you can get so locked in to just Claire's point of view, and this is Jamie and Claire's story. We wanted to show that he was just going to get blindsided. And from that point on, they're together and it becomes their shared story again. That carries us through. We knew ""Droughtlander"" took place, we knew it was a long wait, and we knew that for a lot of the fans, it felt like they waited 20 years for this moment too. To give it to them two times, I don't think it was a bad thing.

Near the end of the episode, Claire comes face-to-face with her nephew Young Ian, and those who have read Voyager know how important of a character he is. What did you need to get right about that first meeting?

To introduce Young Ian, he becomes such an important character for this season, so that initial meeting, we had to do it right and make it special. John Bell brings a likeability to the character. It was important to build that chemistry because of what happens going forward in the season. If there was no spark and no light there, then the whole drive for the second half of the season gets watered down.

That final scene was shocking to watch as Claire gets attacked. Where does the next episode will pick up?

Without giving away too much, as the book did so well, Jamie and Claire get back together and they find a tentative footing in their relationship. We took a breath in this episode to say let's not throw any obstacles at them. The only obstacles thrown at them is themselves, them getting to know each other again. Episode seven and going forward is, as always, the world against Claire and Jamie. All the obstacles you can throw at them, we do.

396,"The Weeknd Passionately Belts Selena Gomez Diss Song At Coachella Just one day after dropping the moody video for his Selena Gomez-inspired track ‘Call Out My Name,’ The Weeknd commanded the Coachella stage during his epic headlining performance!

The Weeknd, 27, took to the stage on April 13 at Coachella to perform hits like “Starboy” and “Can’t Feel My Face,” but he mixed some newer songs in, too, including a tearful rendition of the new single, “Call Out My Name” which was inspired by his ex Selena Gomez! Abel took the stage in the wee hours of April 14 for those on the East Coast, so we’re breaking the performance down here in case you weren’t able to watch the live stream.

The talented singer opened his set with two of his most recognizable tunes, “Pray For Me” and the ultra popular “Starboy.” When he got to “Call Out My Name” in the latter part of his performance, after calling this audience beautiful and expressing his appreciation for them. As soon as he started belting out the lyrics to the emotional tune, it definitely looked like his sweat had a combination of tears to go along with it. Could he have been thinking about his former love Selena while singing lines like, “We found each other, I helped you out of a broken place”? It’s definitely possible! After all, The Weeknd’s known for expressing his emotions through his songs and we love him for it! Nevertheless, between crooning away at his popular hits and letting his guard down in his heartfelt performance of his new tune, we’d say that The Weeknd’s first headlining appearance at Coachella was a major success.

The Weeknd dropped the emotional video for “Call Out My Name” on April 12, sending fans into a frenzy. One summed it up nicely: “Every time that man releases anything , I am in shambles for weeks lmao.” And after Coachella, Abel will continue hitting the festival circuit, with headlining gigs at Panorama NYC, Outside Lands Music & Arts Festival, Lollapalooza Berlin and more.

Beyoncé, Eminem, Cardi B, SZA, Tyler the Creator, Migos, King Krule, Vince Staples, St. Vincent, HAIM, Fleet Foxes, David Byrne and tons more of your favorite artists will be taking the stage at Coachella this weekend, so keep tuning into the live stream in order to not miss a moment!",1

I have very high standards for sci-fi and horror films—I expect to startle and gasp and cover my eyes—and this movie didn’t just clear my very high bar; it vaulted over it. But to be honest, even if it had failed to register on my scare-o-meter, I would have loved it for what it is at its heart: in Rodriguez’s words, “a human story and…bad bitches going into action.”

In the film, which lands in theaters nationwide on Friday, February 23, Rodriguez plays Anya Thorensen, a paramedic who has volunteered to explore The Shimmer, a mystifying, dangerous, ever-expanding territory. Those who go into The Shimmer often don’t return.

Venturing into the force field alongside Anya are women toting guns, ammo, and advanced degrees in STEM: biologist Lena (Natalie Portman), physicist Josie (Tessa Thompson), geologist Cass (Tuva Novotny), and psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Together, they’re determined to do what practically no one else has: enter The Shimmer, discover what it is, and return unscathed.

The role fit Rodriguez like Anya’s well-worn fatigues. “The classic roles that are afforded to me— here, Gina, this is what you’re capable of doing —are usually roles I don’t even relate to,” she says, explaining that she identifies more with layered parts like the main character in Lady Bird than with parts inscribed by one-dimensional Latina stereotypes. Playing Anya? “It felt like butter.”

Maybe that’s because the film could be a metaphor for her life for the last several years: Flanked by her own support squad, Rodriguez has marched headlong into a forbidding reality of chronic illness and come out stronger and bolder than ever. As she asserts her power in her personal life and her career, battling forces that, like The Shimmer, loom large and seemingly beyond her control, she is fighting not just for herself, but for other women in Hollywood and beyond, forging for them a path forward and up.

Rodriguez, 33, has Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune condition that wages war on the thyroid gland , which produces hormones that influence how your body uses energy. Hashimoto’s can lead to an underactive thyroid that doesn’t produce enough of these hormones, and symptoms can be devastating and wide-ranging, including fatigue , joint pain, memory issues, and weight gain , to name a few.

“To the core of my being, I know what it’s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin?”

At first, Rodriguez says, Hashimoto’s felt like “the curse of a lifetime,” especially in an industry that places so much emphasis on size. The disease, though treatable, has no cure. For years after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 19 and Hashimoto’s at 26, and putting on weight that wouldn’t budge, Rodriguez preferred to deny what she was going through rather than focus her efforts on doing whatever she could to feel better. “To the core of my being, I know what it’s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin,” she reflects.

She tried to rebel against what she knew her body needed by not taking her medicine on time, eating foods that she knew would make her feel terrible (looking at you, dairy), or deciding working out wasn’t worth it if it wouldn’t change her body. Eventually, she realized something had to give: “[Hashimoto’s] affects so many aspects of your life. I’ve had it for so many years…that rebellion of not taking care of myself can’t exist anymore.”

Over the years, she started taking her treatments seriously, changing her diet, and working out for health instead of weight loss. Though weight comes off naturally as a result of all her efforts combined, it’s also complicated by what roles she’s working on at a given time. To prepare for her intensely physical role in Annihilation , she weight trained and went vegan, so naturally, her body changed. When she spends 16-hour days on-set playing the titular character in the CW series Jane the Virgin —a role for which she’s determined not to lose weight —she’s at what she calls her “comfortable” weight, which she can maintain without an intense workout regimen and diet changes.

“I’m OK in both of those,” she says. “I’m not less than because I’m 10, 15, 20 pounds more.” On the flip side, she knows it’s not inherently better—that she’s not inherently better—when she happens to weigh less, and that her handling of weight doesn’t say anything about her other than that she’s human.

Five months ago, Rodriguez started working with “a great new nutritionist,” who identified a bunch of common foods that were getting in the way of her health. When she stays away from them, she says, “so many of my ailments are gone. It feels like freedom. This is new. I'm 33. It's taken me a while.""

“I can’t say I’m on point, always on it, because, man, I’m flawed.”

She qualifies: “I can’t say I’m on point, always on it, because, man, I’m flawed.” A raft of most-craved foods rolls off her tongue with ease. “I want the burger and the ice cream and the red velvet cupcakes. I want the croissant with my coffee, even though gluten doesn’t do me justice .” But it helps to remember it’s all about baby steps, about making healthy living a daily , or even hourly, decision. “When you say, just today, I’m going to choose this because I know it’s going to make me feel better, that’s not such a crazy Mount Everest.”

Her boyfriend of one and a half years, Joe LoCicero, has been a cornerstone of the network of friends and family supporting her as she navigates the choppy waters of chronic illness. An actor and martial artist who practices Muay Thai (Thai boxing), LoCicero traveled to Thailand with Rodriguez in late 2016 so they could train in the sport together.

“[He] has really helped me have a healthier perspective on [weight], that stupid number that can destroy us and feel like it’s equivalent to our self-worth,” she says. “This love is so easy,” she adds, describing her relationship with LoCicero as one of “respect and kindness, and generosity, and compromise, and sacrifice.”

It bothers her that another symptom of Hashimoto's—memory troubles—can make it seem like she doesn't always appreciate the little details that make their relationship so great. While she says that her forgetfulness hasn't interfered with memorizing lines, an important part of her job, ""I can't remember maybe a sweet thing my boyfriend has said to me a week ago. Or what we ate yesterday,"" she laments. ""It makes me feel shame. I don't want him to think that I'm not remembering our special moments together. And that stinks.""

Rodriguez rose to fame in 2014 on Jane the Virgin (where she and LoCicero met). The show introduced enthusiastic swaths of America to the delicious drama of Latin American soap operas known as telenovelas. It has everything: murder, romance, and Jane’s accidental artificial insemination as a virgin, to boot. After its first season, the series won a People’s Choice Award and a Peabody, and Rodriguez took home a Golden Globe for best actress in a TV comedy or musical.

“ Jane is just the greatest thing that ever happened to me,” Rodriguez says. But she is quick to point out that she works her ass off to help it—and herself—succeed.

“I didn’t know my worth [at the start of my career] because the industry had such a specific perspective on what it should be as a brown woman,” Rodriguez says. “I had to start saying, ‘Well, I know if I work hard, I can show my worth,’ and I have been doing nothing but that.”

Rodriguez, who studied film at NYU, recently directed her first episode of the show, now in its fourth season. She also started a production company, I Can And I Will Productions, through which she is developing multiple projects with CBS Studios that portray the Latino experience. Stepping behind the camera, she realized it wasn’t some immutable force deciding what she was capable of and what she deserved. It was just other people. That knowledge primed her to advocate for herself. “Especially women, and especially women of color, really have to fight for equal pay,” she says. “My white sisters definitely have a higher starting point, my black sisters as well. Latinos really do live in the lower end of pay .”

“I didn’t know my worth because the industry had such a specific perspective on what it should be as a brown woman. I had to start saying, ‘Well, I know if I work hard, I can show my worth,’ and I have been doing nothing but that.”

A vocal advocate of the Me Too and Time’s Up movements, Rodriguez is harnessing her power to help fight for women not just in her industry, but in all of them. “It’s empowering and encouraging and viscerally stimulating to be a part and lend the little voice I have to this giant cause of beautiful change towards a more fair world, a more fair environment,” Rodriguez says. “It doesn’t take away from anyone or anything. It just makes everything easier and clearer and kinder and makes room for more possibility.”

When I ask about her biggest professional goals, she doesn’t hesitate. “I’m ready to do my movie,” she says, meaning that she wants to direct a feature she’s “been mulling over for a while.” “Whether that means success or failure, I’m ready to go for it.” Other items on the list: producing more, along with creating more positions—both in front of and behind the camera—for women and Latino people, a cause she takes particularly seriously amidst today’s political tensions.

“Obviously I come from a very specific lens and a very specific perspective,” she says. “I of course would love to see Latino communities uplifted and celebrated in a positive light, because our administration loves to show us in such a negative light. That’s going to be a part of my fight.”

Whatever she’s fighting for (or against)—whether it’s better representation in media , chronic illness, fair treatment for women in low-wage service jobs, or a terrifying evil force swallowing people and cities and mutating the world as we know it—Rodriguez is learning that you’ve gotta look out for number one, too.

“I’ve just recently started getting really debilitating panic attacks and anxiety ,” she tells me. At various times, she’s pinned them on first-time-director nerves and the pressure to strike the right tone in her show, on stress and life changes, on “balancing reality with fiction, and reality with the bullshit of social media, the kind of psychological change that’s happening in our climate, period.” But she also realized she was taking too much thyroid medication, which was causing heart palpitations that spiraled into anxiety attacks. She lowered her dosage, and the attacks went away.

“It is really important for us to be super self-aware,” she says. “I wasn’t banking on that. I wasn’t like, hey, yeah, let me get a disease that makes me have to be super aware. I don’t want to be super aware of myself all of the time.”

After our call, I think about how Rodriguez describes Anya: ""She was that person, the one that pays the bills and gets shit done and fixes the car and fixes the leak.” I think about bad bitches going into action, both on and off the screen. But most of all, I think about Rodriguez’s reminder that every woman determined to make things happen—herself and Anya included—is really just a human, after all.",1

March 1, 2016, 5:01 PM UTC / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines

There's good news for former ""Bachelorette"" Emily Maynard and husband Tyler Johnson — and it's familiar news: They're expecting a baby!

Just last year, the couple, who married in 2014, made a similar announcement. Now, eight months after welcoming a baby boy named Jennings, there's another bundle of joy on the way.

""Some might say I’m crazy. Some might call me a glutton for punishment. I’d say I’m a little bit of both,"" Maynard wrote in a blog post for People.com. ""But more than anything, I’m just so excited for this summer to get here. Why you ask? Well … I’m pregnant. Again.""

Maynard said that she realized that she'd given birth to Jennings ""like, two seconds ago,"" and added, ""I guess I should’ve read that part in the baby handbook that says you’re super fertile after giving birth, huh?""

But unexpected or not, she and Johnson couldn't be happier about their growing family.

""I said about two weeks after Jennings was born that I couldn’t wait to have another,"" Maynard explained. ""I just had no clue it would happen so quickly! Some of my closest friends have had a really hard time getting pregnant and my heart breaks for them, so I’m just so grateful for this blessing God has given our family.""

This will be the third child for Maynard, who also has a 10-year-old daughter, Ricki, from her relationship with late NASCAR driver Ricky Hendrick.

So much has changed in Maynard's life over the past few years. In 2011, she received the final rose from Brad Womack on Season 15 of ""The Bachelor."" But months after the finale, they parted ways.

The following year, Maynard looked for love again on ""The Bachelorette."" But despite another seemingly happy ending with contestant Jef Holm, they too broke off their engagement.

In 2013, she met now-husband Johnson.

""I’m living proof that God has an incredible plan for each of us, we just have to be patient enough to wait for Him and His timing!"" she wrote.

399,"Katie Couric Opens Up About Matt Lauer's Firing from the Today Show More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.

“The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

“I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”

The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.

Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.

NBC/Getty

Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.

Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.

“There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”

Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.

In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”

The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.

The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.

“I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”

She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.

“One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”

As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast — and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.

“I’m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,” she says. “I’ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we’re ‘dropping’ episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.

“Meanwhile, I’m still happily married (after three years!) and I’m teaching John how to do Instagram stories,” she continues. “His are pretty lame so far. I’m also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie’s college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I’ll be able to announce soon. I’m addicted to work!",1

401,"Jimmy Kimmel Enlists Help From Katie Couric for First Colonoscopy After recently turning 50, the late-night host chronicled his first procedure alongside the former 'Today' anchor, who famously filmed her colonscopy years ago.

Jimmy Kimmel was ready to take his show to where no late-night program has gone before: to get a colonoscopy.

In the wake of his turning 50, Kimmel enlisted help from Katie Couric to undergo his first colonoscopy procedure. “I know this is something Katie is passionate about and it’s an important thing to do,” the late-night host said about the colon cancer-detecting procedure on Tuesday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! “You’re about to watch a camera go where no camera has gone before.”

Chronicling his early morning visit, Kimmel and Couric ventured to the hospital at 5:30 a.m. where Couric praised the late-night host for being a “big boy” and assured him that once he completes the procedure he won’t have to do it again for another five to 10 years, which Kimmel then jokingly compared to the Olympics.

While waiting for the procedure to begin, Kimmel shared a few quips with Couric about the awkwardness of her being present for his first procedure. “I’m telling you, I met some real perverts in my life, but you take the cake, Katie Couric,” Kimmel told the anchor.

Couric, whose husband died of colon cancer, emphasized that despite the common dread most people feel over getting the procedure done, “it’s a lot more fun than being diagnosed with colorectal cancer.” “You should put that on a bumper sticker. A long bumper sticker,” Kimmel said.

Prior to Kimmel's procedure, Couric poked fun at the late-night host as she challenged the nurses to thoroughly clean his colon enough to find the iTunes gift card she hid inside. “Whoever finds it, it’s yours,” Couric joked.

Later, Kimmel learned that his colonoscopy procedure went smoothly, until Couric admitted that they found some unusual personal items of his along the way such as his car keys, action figures and a harmonica.

402,"Selena Gomez Is 'Surprised' by How Much People Love '13 Reasons Why' Selena Gomez has a lot of feelings about the success of her executive-produced series 13 Reasons Why, but it is, of course, a cause she believes in deeply.

In a recent interview at WE Day (where she was hosting) she told E! News that she is ""a little overwhelmed and very surprised"" about the way people have responded to the show, which tells the story about a teen who dies by suicide and how her classmates cope with the loss. Though a lot of people have watched and talked about the show, many mental health professionals are cautioning against the way it depicts issues like suicide and sexual assault. One thing's for sure: it's definitely gotten people talking.

""I mean I believed in the project for so long and I understood what the message was,"" Selena explained. ""I just wanted it to come across in a way that kids would be frightened, but confused — in a way that they would talk about it because it's something that's happening all the time. So, I'm overwhelmed that's it's doing as well as it's doing.""

Plenty of people have been wondering if 13 Reasons Why will be returning for a second season, and there are some signs that make it look like it'll be happening. When asked if she would do another season of the show, Selena gave a little smirk and said ""maybe.""

Along with Selena's mysterious response to the question, Katherine Langford who plays main character Hannah Baker in the show recently said in an interview: ""There's definitely more story to tell. It would be cool to continue the dialogue of this story. There are so many cliffhangers at the end of the season."" It seems that she's behind it, and with Netflix's good graces, we could be gearing up for even more of Selena's producing skills.

404,"Milo Ventimiglia Asks ‘This Is Us’ Fans to ‘Forgive’ in Crock-Pot Ad Milo Ventimiglia is asking fans to “forgive” in a hilarious — yet bittersweet — promo ahead of This Is Us’ highly anticipated episode following the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 4.

“The big game is fast approaching and for many of us, this day brings us an opportunity to gather with friends and family, loved ones we don’t get to see all that often,” Ventimiglia, who plays Jack Pearson on the hit show, begins.

“But in 2018, gathering friends and family, well, it’s not as easy as what it used to be. The country is divided. Sometimes that can make it tough to find common ground, but this year … this year, I think we should all take a deep breath, find the ability to forgive, and remind ourselves there is no difference so great that we can’t overcome it,” the Gilmore Girls alum, 39, concludes, before scooping chili out of a Crock-Pot into a bowl as the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent appears on the screen.

The promo is in response to the January 23 episode of This Is Us, which ended with Jack walking around the kitchen, tidying up. Before heading to bed, he turns off the family’s Crock-Pot — but due to its old age and faulty switch, the slow cooker switched back on and started a fire that many believe took the beloved character’s life. Following the episode, upset fans tweeted about Crock-Pots, with many saying they refuse to use the household appliance.

The outrage prompted series creator Dan Fogelman to tweet, “Taking a moment to remind everyone that it was a 20 year old fictional crockpot with an already funky switch? Let’s not just lump all those lovely hardworking crockpots together.”

Crock-Pot released its own statement a few days later, assuring viewers that the product is safe to use: “Crock-Pot understands the concerns brought up by the recent episode of This Is Us, and we too are heartbroken by the latest development in Jack’s story line. However, it is important that our consumers understand and have confidence that all Crock-Pot slow cookers exceed all internal testing protocols and all applicable industry safety standards and regulations as verified by independent third-party testing labs. For nearly 50 years, with over 100 million Crock-Pots sold, we have never received any consumer complaints similar to the fictional events portrayed in last night’s episode. In fact, the safety and design of our product renders this type of event nearly impossible.”

“Our hope is that the team at NBC’s This Is Us will help us spread factual information regarding our product’s safety. While we know their primary mission is to entertain – something they have continued to excel in – we also feel they have a responsibility to inform,” the statement concluded. “Just like many fans, we will be watching next week’s episode to see how Jack’s story progresses and, regardless of the outcome, we want consumers first and foremost to know they are safe when using their Crock-Pot.”

As loyal fans of the hit NBC series know, this Sunday’s episode of This Is Us is going to be a big one: viewers will finally find out what caused Jack’s death. In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, the Rocky Balboa star promised he is here for Us, saying he is open to giving heartbroken fans “hugs” following the devastating reveal.

405,"The Black Girl’s Guide to Gorgeous, Glowy Skin Just because summer is long gone doesn’t mean we still don’t want to glow like J.Lo. So we sought out Kat Leverette, a licensed esthetician, ethnic skincare expert and owner of Clinically Clear Skin Rehab Center, for advice on achieving a glowy, even-toned complexion. Follow these tips for gorgeous, lit-from-within skin all year long.

Wash Your Face Before Bedtime

Cleanse your skin gently, especially at night, as a vital part of your bedtime routine. Unclogging pores of the day’s oil and grime is important for keeping skin clear.

Use a Low-Lathering, Sulfate-Free Cleanser

A gentle cleanser removes makeup and excess oil without stripping your skin. If your skin feels tight and dry after washing, you’re using something too strong. Opt for a creamy face wash, like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser.

Take It Easy

“Cleanse with your fingertips and rinse by splashing water on your face. Pat dry. Don’t roughly rub your skin dry with a towel. The pressure of a washcloth or towel and friction from sonic brushing may feel good and appeal to your desire to be squeaky clean, but can cause darker, uneven skin tone and aggravate acne. Instead, dry skin with small, gentle pats or let it air dry,” advises Leverette.

Exfoliate Your Skin

But not too aggressively or too often. “Over-scrubbing is like giving yourself a rope burn — causing irritation and a darker, uneven skin tone. Avoid using washcloths, spa gloves, buffing pads, sonic scrubbers or coarse scrubs. Choose a fine-grain scrub made with jojoba beads or other environment-friendly beads instead,” says Leverette. “And don’t rub hard — use light pressure in a gentle circular motion.”

Noncomedogenic sunflower oil and table sugar blended together make an excellent all-over exfoliator. Apply in the shower before you turn the water on. Massage all over using gentle pressure. Rinse off and pat dry.

Try an Alcohol-Free Toner Mist

Spritz your face with a refreshing facial spray to hydrate skin and set makeup. On extra hot days, mist throughout the day to rehydrate.

Hydrate From Within

If you are dehydrated, your skin will look dull. Leverette recommends drinking half your weight in ounces of water or non-caffeinated beverages like herbal tea for a healthy flush.

Go Easy on the Oil

You want a glow, not an oil slick. “Resist the urge to slather your skin and scalp with heavy oils. If you’re acne-prone, you’ll pay the price with clogged pores, blackheads and pimples,” says Leverette. “Opt for fragrance-free sunflower oil for the same effect and clearer skin.”

Moisturize

To keep your skin supple and soft, Leverette suggests using lotions and moisturizers that contain ceramides. “Ceramides are a major component of our skin’s surface that protect against moisture loss to keep your skin youthful, supple, moist and glowing.” Try CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion.

Get Even

Dark spots and blotchy skin can mar a beautiful complexion. Look for products with skin-brightening ingredients, like licorice, mulberry, bearberry and kojic acid. These ingredients gradually fade hyperpigmentation and encourage an even, radiant hue.

Natural Camouflage

If you need extra coverage, smooth on a luminous foundation or tinted moisturizer for a natural, radiant finish. Or try light-diffusing BB creams for a photo-filtered effect.

Protect Your Skin

Lack of sun damage will keep your skin dewy and supple for years to come. “Yes, darker skin needs protection too, especially on overcast days because the UVA penetrates clouds and windshields. If your skin darkens at all, it’s sun damage in the making,” says Leverette. “Makeup with sunscreen added is not enough protection. Technology has made it possible for physical sunscreens like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to go on sheer. Use SPF 30 and apply with a massage motion with the palm of your hand, gently working the sunscreen into the skin. But be cautious; sheer sunscreens use chemical sunscreening agents that provide less protection against the longer UVA rays.”

Go for the Glow

Take some loose pearlescent (not glittery) gold, peach or bronze eye powder shadow. Mix a tiny bit in the palm of your hand with a few drops of foundation, sunscreen or moisturizer. Apply to outer cheeks and brow bone for an extra touch of luminosity.

Eat Healthy

A low-sugar, antioxidant-rich diet consisting of colorful fruits and vegetables (especially leafy greens), legumes and lean protein will ensure you’re healthy inside as well as out for a natural glow.

Work It Out

Working out gives you all the beauty benefits that money can’t buy. Exercising at least 30 minutes a day gets your heart pumping and increases circulation by bringing oxygen into your bloodstream. It’s the best way to achieve a youthful glow.

Kim Zolciak-Biermann, current Don't Be Tardy star and former Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member, hit up Chrissy Teigen on Twitter Wednesday with a tongue-in-cheek offer of oral sex on behalf of her 20-year-old daughter Brielle in exchange for meeting John Legend at one of his shows:

@chrissyteigen sooo ur hubby is comin to ATL may19 & Kash is beyond OBSESSED w him! who does Brielle have to blow in order to meet him?? LOL — Kim ZolciakBiermann (@Kimzolciak) May 4, 2017

Teigen replied with a joke of her own, telling Zolciak-Biermann ""it's not that good of a show"" and that tickets could be acquired without the utilization of oral sex:

@Kimzolciak Plz don't blow anyone it's not that good of a show. Jk it's good but I'll get you tix without the oral — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 4, 2017

Without fail, some attempted to criticize the joke as if oral sex were actually being used as a currency:

BRB. I need to take a sighing break.

For the record, Brielle is cool with the joke:

And she isn't a fan of some publications' coverage methods:

Zolciak-Biermann later told TMZ that anyone who regularly pays attention to her account would know that's simply her ""sense of humor."" She also had a message for those still up in arms about the tweet: ""If you can't take a joke, feel free to unfollow,"" she said Thursday.

So let's all just shut the fuck up about it. If you don't like what a celebrity tweets, unfollow their account and go about your life as if it never happened. Deal? Great. There are more important things going on.",1

The online car marketplace Autotrader called Bee's comments ""unacceptable"" in a Twitter statement announcing its withdrawal from advertising on the TBS show.

Thank you to those who reached out regarding our sponsorship of Full Frontal. The comments expressed by Samantha Bee were offensive and unacceptable and do not reflect the views of our company. As a result, we have suspended our sponsorship of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. — Autotrader (@AutoTrader_com) May 31, 2018

Autotrader was the first known sponsor of the show to cut ties with Bee, though it was followed soon after by insurer State Farm.

On her Wednesday night show, Bee knocked the first daughter and White House adviser over posting a photo with her young son while the Trump administration separates immigrant families at the border.

“You know, Ivanka, that’s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another: Do something about your dad’s immigration practices, you feckless c---,"" Bee said.

The ""Daily Show"" alumna later apologized for her remarks, but not before the White House said ""Full Frontal"" was ""not fit for broadcast.""

“The language used by Samantha Bee last night is vile and vicious,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.

TBS also apologized for the off-color comment, but indicated that the quick-snapping host would not face punishment.

409,"Daniel Radcliffe breaks silence on Johnny Depp casting controversy Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is weighing in on the controversy surrounding the casting of Johnny Depp in the spin-off film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.

EW asked the actor about the uproar over Depp playing the infamous wizard Gillert Grindelwald in the upcoming film after the abuse allegations made by his ex-wife Amber Heard. The film’s writer J.K. Rowling, director David Yates, and studio Warner Bros. have all issued statements defending the casting. Some fans have been supportive of Depp’s involvement, while others are rather outraged.

“It’s a very hard thing for me,” Radcliffe said, noting he wants to be supportive of the film’s producers who “gave me a great start in life and an amazing job.”

But, he added, “I can see why people are frustrated with the response that they were given from that … I’m not saying anything that anybody hasn’t already said — and this is a weird analogy to draw — [but] in the NFL, there are lots of players arrested for smoking weed and there is other people’s behavior that goes way beyond that and it’s tolerated because they’re very famous players. I suppose the thing I was struck by was, we did have a guy who was reprimanded for weed on the [original Potter] film, essentially, so obviously what Johnny has been accused of is much greater than that.”

Radcliffe is referring to actor Jamie Waylett, who played Hogwarts bully Vincent Crabbe. After appearing in six Harry Potter films, Waylett was dropped from the two-part adaptation of Deathly Hallows after being arrested for growing 10 marijuana plants in 2009. Waylett being dropped for his pot offense is sometimes referenced by fans who protest Depp’s casting. The actor was a virtual unknown when he was axed from the Potter franchise and — unlike Depp — was arrested and pleaded guilty to growing pot plants in his mother’s home. Waylett was later arrested for packing a homemade bomb during the 2011 London riots.

Radcliffe next stars in the upcoming TBS anthology series Miracle Workers, an office comedy set in heaven.

Depp’s titular casting in The Crimes of Grindelwald has been a divisive flashpoint issue for the sequel due to his ex-wife Amber Heard’s claim he emotionally and physically abused her during their whirlwind marriage. The couple released a joint statement after their divorce was finalized in 2016. “Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future. Amber will be donating financial proceeds from the divorce to a charity,” they said.

Rowling weighed in with a defense of keeping Depp on the film, writing, “Based on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies.”

Studio Warner Bros. also released a statement, noting, “We are of course aware of reports that surfaced around the end of Johnny Depp’s marriage, and take seriously the complexity of the issues involved. This matter has been jointly addressed by both parties, in a statement in which they said ‘there was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.’ Based on the circumstances and the information available to us, we, along with the filmmakers, continue to support the decision to proceed with Johnny Depp in the role of Grindelwald in this and future films.”

The Crimes of Grindelwald will be released Nov. 16.

Radcliffe spoke to EW while promoting Miracle Workers at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour in Pasadena. He noted that he signed on to the project because he wanted to get rich — Simon Rich, the Man Seeking Woman creator. “It’s Simon’s writing and the fact that it’s going to be an anthology series,” explains Radcliffe. “Essentially, I’m getting the chance to ride on his coattails for three years. He’s one of the best writers around. As an actor, to have an opportunity to have a writer of that caliber say, ‘We’re going to work on a new story every year and find a new character to play every year for the next few years,’ that’s just a bit of a dream, really.”",1
410,"The Challenge's Sarah Rice Reveals She Suffered a Miscarriage The Challenge‘s Sarah Rice is opening up about her devastating miscarriage.

Rice, 32, revealed on The Brain Candy Podcast on Thursday that she previously suffered a miscarriage, telling listeners and cohost Susie Meister that she had planned to reveal the “surprise” of her pregnancy to her followers.

“It was so exciting, it was great. It was so hard to keep my mouth shut,” Rice said. “But, then I got another surprise when I went in for my first ultrasound at 12 weeks and the baby didn’t have a heartbeat, so no more baby and I had a miscarriage, so that was really hard.”

“I think for the first time in my entire life, I felt sorrow. I had felt grief before. I felt loss,” said the reality star, who married boyfriend Landon Patterson in May 2015. “This was an experience that I didn’t know what this feeling was.”

“Landon was the one who said… you felt grief, this is sorrow,” she said. “You can’t explain it away. Okay well, there’s something chromosomally abnormal with the baby so your body does what it’s supposed to do, which is terminate the pregnancy so that you can only have healthy babies.”

Although she understands that the miscarriage was her body’s natural response, she said her emotional responses were not in tune with her body at all.

“Your body doesn’t communicate that to your emotional side at all. What was really traumatizing for me was that the baby stopped growing at about nine weeks and I didn’t find out ’til 12 weeks and so, I felt like a coffin and then that I was, like, loving and romanticizing something that had been dead inside me,” she said. “They said my mind wasn’t convinced that I wasn’t pregnant, but my body was.”

Rice revealed that while she considered herself knowledgeable in medical terms and subjects, she was still taken by surprise when her doctor told her the baby would have to be removed through a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, which would require surgically removing the fetus.

“I had never, ever, ever heard of that. Not once. This really is the last taboo of what we’re not able to just talk about,” she said. “I was like, God I have to talk about this. This was so much more upsetting than I thought it was going to be.”

While it took her time to overcome her trauma from losing her child, as well as the procedure she underwent, Rice said, “There is a light at the end of the tunnel … I feel better.”

“I feel like what really helped was moving my body, was like being around friends, too,” she continued. “I didn’t want anybody to tell me ‘I’m sorry’ again.”

“I’m sure everybody’s journey through this is totally different,” Rice added. “I think that there are just so many ways that people can heal and you kind of have to find your own.”

On Instagram Thursday, Rice shared a photo of herself with Patterson, writing in the caption, “This last month was a tough one. @iatewhat and I had some big plans and then all of a sudden things changed, as they often do. In the latest episode of the @braincandypodcast, I share our story. It wasn’t easy, but I hope it lets other women out there know they are not alone.💕💕💕💕.”",1

Jennifer also shared a picture of her little author holding a binder of her book titled Lord Help Me! The proud mom added the hashtag ""#lordhelpme."" While it's yet to be published, Emme's book already has cover art of a young girl kneeling down praying. The 48-year-old singer shares Emme and her twin brother, Max, with ex-husband Marc Anthony.

A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlozone) on Jun 28, 2018 at 12:24pm PDT

Emme is proving to be just as creative as her mother. Earlier this month Jennifer’s daughter participated in a dance recital along with boyfriend Alex Rodriguez’s daughters, Ella, ten, and Natasha, 13. The Shades of Blue star couldn’t contain her excitement during the show, which featured dance numbers set to her songs Jenny from the Block and On the Floor. Jennifer proudly exclaimed, “They’re killing me right now!”

J.Lo has previously opened up about her twins and the impact they've had on her life. “They just make my life so much better. I’m forever grateful,” she said during a 2017 appearance on NBC’s TODAY. “I didn’t have kids until later. I almost thought that I wasn’t going to happen for me. So I’m very aware that I was blessed with that and it could have been something different. So I don’t take it for granted.”",1
412,"Drake: New album ‘Scorpion’ features Michael Jackson and Jay-Z Drake has unveiled his new album Scorpion. The 25-song double album features the singles God’s Plan, Nice for What and I’m Upset, and is currently available to stream and download.

Scorpion includes a posthumous appearance from Michael Jackson, with an old recording of the King of Pop summoned from the archives and deployed on the song Don’t Matter To Me. Elsewhere, Talk Up incorporates a verse from Jay-Z, while After Dark features Ty Dolla $ign and Static Major, a singer and producer who died in 2008.

Drake also appears to confirm rumours that he secretly fathered a son. The Toronto star has recently been involved in a feud with rapper Pusha T who last month released The Story of Adidon, a song that accused of Drake fathering and hiding a child.

“I wasn’t hiding my kid from the world,” Drake raps on Emotionless, which features a prominent Mariah Carey sample. “I was hiding the world from my kid.”

Elsewhere, March 14 appears to be dedicated to Drake’s son while obliquely covering the circumstances of his birth and his relationship with child’s mother. “Shit, we only met two times,” raps Drake on a song that again sees him echo Michael Jackson: “She not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.”

He also appears to address his son directly: “I don’t want you to worry about whose house you live at/ Or who loves you more, or who’s not there.”

Drake may have also drawn a line under the beef with Pusha, a feud the Canadian is widely regarded to have lost. “You know a wise man once said nothin’ at all,” he raps on Emotionless.",1
413,"Feud Alert?! Patti LuPone Calls Madonna 'Dead Behind the Eyes' and 'a Movie Killer' on WWHL Broadway legend (and a New Yorker I’d be terrified to encounter in public) Patti LuPone appeared on Watch What Happens Live! Tuesday night, and fielded a question about Madonna’s, uh, interpretation, of her iconic role in Andrew Lloyd Weber’s Evita.

The musical, for which LuPone won a Tony, was adapted into a successful film in 1996. But even though Madonna won a Golden Globe for her performance, LuPone (who admits she’s never watched the full movie) wasn’t impressed.

In the musical, the character of Eva Peron famously sings, “It won’t be easy, you’ll think it strange, when I try to explain how I feel.” This is a problem Ms. LuPone has never had. Here’s her full quote in all its glory:

“I thought it [the scene I saw] was a piece of shit. Madonna is a movie killer. She’s dead behind the eyes. She couldn’t act her way out of a paper bag. She should not be on film or on stage. She’s a wonderful, you know, performer for what she does, but she is not an actress. Bing.”

LuPone also reveals that the only thing Madonna has “ever” said to her was, “I’m taller than you.”

Wedding bells will soon be ringing at Grey Sloan!

EW can exclusively reveal that Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Alex (Justin Chambers) will be getting married in the season 14 finale of Grey’s Anatomy.

Slated to air Thursday, May 17, the finale is gearing up to be a big event — which, in the world of Shondaland, means things will certainly go awry.

“I am so excited for Jo and Alex to finally seal the deal and get married,” Luddington tells EW. “But in true Jolex form, the wedding will have lots of twists and turns to it.” See?

EW’s exclusive photo from the wedding definitely seems to speak to impending disaster.

Image zoom Eric McCandless/ABC

It’s been a long road to the altar for these two. After his failed marriage to Izzie (Katherine Heigl) in the early years of Grey’s, Alex and Jo started dating in season 9. But the couple hit a major roadblock at the end of season 12 when Jo rebuffed Alex’s proposal, afraid to reveal her name wasn’t actually Jo Wilson — it was Brooke Stadler — and she was still married to an abusive man from whom she ran.

After Alex nearly landed in jail back in season 13 — long story involving him beating up DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), whom he believed was hooking up with Jo — and Jo’s estranged ex Paul (Matthew Morrison) ended up dead in season 14, Jo ultimately proposed to Alex earlier this year.

The ABC medical drama will also close out the season with emotional farewells to longtime series regulars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew. Geena Davis will be reprising her role as Dr. Nicole Herman, who returns to discuss an exciting opportunity with Arizona, seemingly signaling how Arizona will exit.

Details on Drew’s departure are being kept under wraps, but the logline for the penultimate episode, in which Davis also returns, does tease that one of Grey Sloan Memorial’s own will be seriously injured, prompting the team to reflect on what is truly important to them. Could their patient end up being Drew’s character April? We’ll find out when the penultimate hour airs on May 10.

“I read in an interview recently and I think it’s absolutely true: men have it just as bad,” the actor told The Sunday Morning Herald. “Well, not just as bad but they get it bad and it’s never talked about.

“I remember doing one job when they literally made me pull my shirt up and were grabbing my fat and going ‘you need to lose a bit of weight’. This other time they were slapping me. I felt like a piece of meat,” he said.

The actor, who will next appear in “My Cousin Rachel” opposite Rachel Weisz, said he continues to stay “insecure” about his body and sometimes won’t eat for weeks to get the body producers are looking for.

“I’m not saying it’s anywhere near as bad as what women go through but I, as an actor approaching each job, am insecure — especially when I have to take my top off in it — and so nervous,” he added. “I get really worked up to the point where I spend hours and hours in the gym and not eating for weeks to achieve what I think they’re going for.”

The 30-year-old said actors are held to different standards these days.

“In the ’50s and ’60s, it was never an issue,” he said. “James Bond never had a six pack. He had a hairy chest. Marlon Brando​ in ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’ had an incredible body but he was by no means ripped to within an inch of his life. There’s a filter on society that this is normal but actually it’s anything but normal.”

See Video: Emma Thompson Recalls Defending Hayley Atwell From Body-Shaming Movie Producer

This isn’t the first time Claflin has spoken out about his body. In December, the actor clarified that in a particular photograph, his face was photoshopped onto a male’s body.

Celebrities that have spoken out about body shaming include Chrissy Metz, Amy Schumer, Daisy Ridley, Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato and Emma Stone. Even Vin Diesel fell victim to the shaming: After photos surfaced of Diesel with a “softer” physique than fans are used to, the actor said, “I do think it’s wrong to body shame.

Upon getting engaged, Kufrin felt overjoyed. “I felt like my heart was going to burst because it was just so filled with love to be with him and share that news with our friends and family. There was so much excitement and joy,” she says. “It was an overabundance.”

But after filming wrapped and the newly engaged couple returned back to the U.S., Luyendyk Jr. was unsettled with his decision — admitting on the show that he still had feelings for 26-year-old Burnham.

“I never thought for a million years that once the going started to get tough that he would throw in the towel and jump ship and say, ‘Oh sorry, I changed my mind.’ I didn’t think we were at that point whatsoever,” says Kufrin.

After having a sit-down conversation with Burnham, Luyendyk Jr. decided to call off his engagement with Kufrin during a weekend trip to Los Angeles.

“I thought we were just going to have a nice romantic weekend. The night before he had turned off his phone, which I thought was strange, and it wasn’t until the moment when he walked into the house when he didn’t have his suitcases with him, I was like What’s going on?” she shares.

Reflecting on the tear-filled moment Luyendyk Jr. broke up with Kufrin, she says, “It was embarrassing the way he broke up with me with the full cameras and crew around.”

“There was a better and more tactful way to do it,” she says of getting dumped on national television. “A breakup is hard enough, and to have it all filmed and have to re-watch it and know that people all across the country are watching you get your heart broken, it is embarrassing. It’s not fun. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. It was like a slap in the face.”

“I wish he would have been more honest with me. From the questions I was asking, I would have appreciated the full truth. I was obviously blindsided like, Did I miss something? I was asking you these things and you didn’t tell me. What did I miss? How could I have not seen any of this to the extent of how it played out?” she shares.

“At one point I asked him if he wanted to make it work with Lauren and his response was, ‘Yeah I want to try.’ So in that instance I knew. I knew at that point, okay I’m sure he’s going to try to make up for lost time and he’ll probably go there soon to make it work and to reconcile with her,” she says.

While Kufrin credits Luyendyk Jr. for being “open and honest in the fact that he had told Lauren he loved her too,” she says that “red flags were being raised” when season 22 of the series premiered Jan. 1.

“At that point, I knew that he had liked some of her Instagram photos so we had a conversation about it. And that was the first time that he really threw it out that he should have a conversation with her and just apologize for how things had ended with her, that he had felt guilty,” she says.

Says Kufrin: “He had told me, ‘I still have feelings for her, I’m trying to work through them.’ He said it was hard for him to always talk about it in interviews with the press, to relive that relationship. He said he couldn’t close that chapter until everything was said and done and the finale aired. That whole time we were just looking at the end goal of this week to finally be done with that and move on and be together and work through it as a team.”

Realizing that Luyendyk Jr. was still liking Burnham’s photos on social media, Kufrin admits she “definitely went through all of the emotions. I was upset, I was angry at times, I felt betrayed. When I started noticing those little things like the Instagram likes, I was trying to come at it from a relationship standpoint to compromise and talk through it.”

“I would question if he was ready to be engaged and if he was ready at that point to get down on one knee and if not, I’d still stand by him and want to work through it. But of course I’m going to go through all the emotions. I’m a girl, I’m a human being. There was still jealousy there. You’re engaged to me, why are you liking another person’s photos or still wanting to contact them?” she shares.

Ultimately, Kufrin wishes Luyendyk Jr. had “been much more open and honest about the extent of his feelings” — and not proposed to her.

“I wish he hadn’t proposed. At that point I loved him and I wanted to be with him. Even if on that last day, he said, ‘I’m still uncertain, this is a big move, I don’t want to get down on one knee unless I’m 1000 percent sure, but I still want to be with you,’ I would have been fine with that. I would have been like, ‘I love you, I still want to be with you.’ I even asked him a couple times if he felt like he was certain like that was the right move at that point and every time he said, ‘I’m happy with the decision and I feel confident in us,’ ” Kufrin says. “From what he was telling me and from even that grand gesture, I thought nobody would do that unless they did feel 100 percent confident.”

Kufrin says she “can’t fault” Luyendyk Jr. “for falling in love with Lauren and following his heart because I would never want anyone to stay in a relationship where they felt trapped and it wasn’t right,” but she wishes he’d done things differently.

“He did get down on one knee, he did propose to me, he did say, ‘I’m committing to you, I choose you every day.’ That’s something that I only wanted to happen once in my life, and it’s been robbed from me ,and I can never have that one time moment again. And the second part is that he lied or hid his true feelings and emotions for weeks and weeks and weeks,” she says. “The number one thing that I value in a relationship is honesty and loyalty, and I feel like I wasn’t given that.”

Although Kufrin is heartbroken over the situation, she has no “ill will towards” Burnham.

“At the end of the day, we both just fell in love with the same guy and she can’t help that. The only person that I can fault in this is Arie and the way he handled it,” she shares. “I do feel a little bad that it’s going to be really tough for them when all of this is said and done. Social media is a hard world to navigate through, and there’s going to be a lot of negativity and I don’t think she deserves that. If they want to make it work, then they will, and I hope they’re strong enough to get through it all.”

With her breakup behind her, Kufrin says she’s ready for “this chapter of Arie to be done and close it and put it on the shelf and put it away” and only wants Luyendyk Jr. to have what makes him happy.

“At the end of the day I wouldn’t’ change the experience because I met so many amazing people and I fell in love and I had this great experience and memories,” she says. “I’m still going to feel a sense of compassion for him because I did love him but at this point, I want him to be happy, I want to be done and not have to worry about them anymore.”

“They’re going to be together and do their thing. I wanted to move on and have my person that I can focus on and live my life with,” shares Kufrin. “At the end of the day, I do forgive him.”

422,"Harvey Weinstein Could Have a Toxic Effect on Georgina Chapman's Fashion Line. Here's What We Know Georgina Chapman, co-founder of the Marchesa fashion line, saw her label soar to prominence and profits—thanks in some measure to Harvey Weinstein, the rich and powerful movie mogul she married in 2007.

Now that Weinstein has become a pariah, engulfed in allegations of sexual harassment from well over a dozen women including famous actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow, Rose McGowan, and Ashley Judd, it’s widely believed that Chapman’s Marchesa label will suffer a dramatic fall—at least in Hollywood circles.

“No star is ever going to want to wear the brand again,” one publicist told the Hollywood Reporter.

That publicist asked to remain anonymous, and indeed, few sources will speak on the record or make any comment at all about Weinstein, Chapman, or Marchesa. It seems that the Weinstein scandal is so toxic that retailers, Hollywood insiders, and pros in the fashion business don’t want to be linked to it in any way.

In statements, Weinstein has said that has “behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain.” He officially resigned from the production firm he co-founded, the Weinstein Company, this week, and is believed to be seeking treatment in Arizona. A Weinstein spokesperson also said that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,” and “there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”

Here’s what we know about what Weinstein has meant for Chapman and her Marchesa label—and how Chapman’s business interests and net worth could be impacted by the revelations about her husband.

Georgina Chapman’s Net Worth Before Her Split from Harvey Weinstein

Right after the first sexual misconduct allegations surfaced earlier this month, Weinstein said his wife was “100 percent behind me.” But Chapman soon announced she was separating from her husband. “My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,” Chapman said in a released statement. “I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”

Weinstein responded to news of the separation by saying that he supports his wife’s decision. “I am in counseling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild,” he said in a statement. “There has been a lot of pain for my family that I take full responsibility for.”

Chapman, 41, was born in London and attended the Chelsea College of Art and Design, where she met her future business partner, Keren Craig. The two co-founded Marchesa together in 2004, the same year that Chapman started dating Weinstein, 24 years her senior. Chapman has periodically worked as a model and actress. Marchesa launched a bridal line in 2008, roughly six months after Weinstein and Chapman were married.

Chapman has an estimated net worth of £15 million, or roughly $20 million, compared to $250 million to $300 million for her husband, Harvey Weinstein. The couple sold a home in Connecticut for $1.65 million in early October, and still own two other oceanfront homes in Connecticut, each assessed at over $7 million. The couple hosted a lavish $38,500-per-person Barack Obama fundraiser in 2012 at their compound in the state.

Another home owned by Weinstein and Chapman—a 9,000-square-foot waterfront mansion in the Hamptons—was put on the market in August with an asking price of $12.4 million. The couple’s main home is a townhouse in New York City’s West Village, which they purchased for $15 million in 2007.

How these properties might be divided is a mystery. According to E! News, Chapman and Weinstein signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married in late 2007. The terms of their separation and likely divorce are unknown. “You would anticipate at least the vast majority of the financial side of this to be handled behind closed doors with the business managers,” a family law specialist told E!

It also remains murky how Chapman’s separation from Weinstein might impact her business interests, including Marchesa. Marchesa has not responded to MONEY’s requests for comment.

Actresses Tied to Harvey Weinstein Have Worn Marchesa on the Red Carpet for Years

With red carpet season on the horizon, the choice of designers worn by actresses will demonstrate implicitly how Hollywood feels about Marchesa—and, by extension, Chapman and Weinstein.

Ten years ago, the New York Times observed that Marchesa’s designs had enjoyed a “Short Walk to the Red Carpet,” with actresses like Jennifer Lopez and Sienna Miller wearing the previously low-profile label to events like the Golden Globes.

There was an explanation for why Marchesa was suddenly favored by A-listers: The gossip indicated that Weinstein, who was dating Chapman at the time and had provided funding for the brand, was in the habit of strong-arming actresses tied to his productions into wearing Marchesa dresses.

Now, many signs suggest the gossip was true. Felicity Huffman confirmed that Weinstein said he would not put money behind her film, Transamerica, unless she wore Marchesa on the red carpet. Many other actresses involved in Weinstein-backed films, including Renee Zellweger, Mischa Barton, Cate Blanchett, and Sienna Miller, also appear to have been asked to wear Marchesa during awards season.

At Least One Marchesa Partnership Has Folded

On October 5—the same day the New York Times published the first of multiple reports about Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct—Helzberg Diamonds announced the launch of a partnership with Marchesa for a line new of diamond engagement rings, priced from $2,499 to $9,499. It was supposed to be called the Marchesa Radiant Star Collection.

Soon, though, around the time that another bombshell story about Weinstein’s alleged harassment was published by the New Yorker, mention of Marchesa disappeared from Helzberg’s website. The Kansas City-based firm, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, soon released a short statement, without elaborating, that “the company is not launching the Marchesa brand at this time,” to the Hollywood Reporter.

One wedding stylist told the New York Post that, generally speaking, the brand’s sales are likely to flail in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, and a fashion publicist said that Marchesa employees are trying to find other jobs. An anonymous retailer also told the Post that some stores will probably stop selling Marchesa products.

However, Marchesa dresses and jewelry are still widely available for purchase from major retailers such as Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdoff Goodman.

While most retailers have chosen not to comment on Marchesa, Chapman, or Weinstein, at least one upscale seller has voiced support for the brand. “Bergdoff Goodman and Marchesa have been longtime partners — we were the first store to pick up the brand when it launched in 2004. We have been avid supporters of Georgina and Keren’s work ever since and hope to continue supporting the brand in the future,” Linda Fargo, a senior vice president for Bergdoff Goodman said recently, according to Women’s Wear Daily.

More Backlash Against Marchesa and Chapman to Follow?

“We all knew celebrities were asked to wear Marchesa if they were in a Weinstein movie,” the co-owner of a fashion communications company who asked to remain anonymous recently said to the New York Times. “They were supposed to wear it at least once. We all knew that cycle.”

Now, however, with Weinstein powerless and out of the picture, that cycle is broken. It is unclear if Chapman knew about any of the alleged misconduct on the behalf of her husband, but entertainment industry experts say her brand will suffer from guilt by association.

Weinstein is “very much a figure who has been a bridge between Hollywood and the fashion worlds. So I think it’s going to be hard to disentangle Marchesa from his image,” Booth Moore, the fashion news director for the Hollywood Reporter, who has covered the Weinstein scandal extensively, explained in an interview with NPR. “I think that people really are voting with their dollars or, you know, really are emotional about the way that they spend money nowadays so that this scandal could affect the fortunes of Marchesa.”

Kim Vernon, the president and CEO of the Vernon Co. brand consultancy, told Women’s Wear Daily (WWD) that she “would expect that most of those actresses would distant [sic] themselves from wearing those gowns at their awards and red-carpet events.”

However, Vernon still thinks that Marchesa won’t necessarily be dropped by mainstream retailers, and that the brand could still have a promising future even if its dresses are never again regularly worn by stars: “I think they can have a successful business without Hollywood. They do a real business with the Notte second line and a lot of licensed products.”

Marchesa sales might not be affected much in some stores. One retailer spokesperson, who chose to remain anonymous, told WWD that Marchesa sales have been “really fantastic,” and that “our customer really hasn’t connected the dots that he [Weinstein] and she [Chapman] are married.”",1
423,"Rebecca Gayheart Files for Divorce From Eric Dane After 14 Years of Marriage Rebecca Gayheart has filed for divorce from Eric Dane after 14 years of marriage, PEOPLE confirms.

“After 14 years together we have decided that ending our marriage is the best decision for our family,” Dane, 45, said in a statement to PEOPLE.

Gayheart, best known for films such as Jawbreaker and Scream 2, filed for divorce on Friday in Los Angeles according to court documents obtained by The Blast.

The actress, 46, is requesting joint legal and physical custody of the couple’s two daughters: 7-year-old Billie and 6-year-old Georgia.

The Jawbreaker star is also seeking spousal support, according to the divorce documents.

Speaking to PEOPLE in 2014, the actor said, “We’ve all made mistakes. My one regret is that I got the person I love most wrapped up in all that: Rebecca.”

Of his family life, Dane said he feels happiest when he’s at home with them.

“I never had a family, and now I do,” he said, noting his father died when he was 7. “I know I’m a very lucky guy.”

428,"Jenni Rivera's 'Unbreakable' Autobiography Reveals Star's Darkest Moment And Only True Love On a dark January night in 1997, in the backseat of a white sports car, Jenni Rivera’s life changed forever.

It’s with this emotionally charged description of the rape that “shattered” her soul that La Diva de la Banda begins her official autobiography, “Unbreakable: My Story, My Way.” From this moment of vulnerability the Mexican-American singer narrates her journey through adversity and happiness, describing in detail some of her most traumatic experiences and revealing the identity of her only true love.

Unafraid to bare her soul to her fans, Rivera recounts within the first five pages the scarring sexual assault that would always linger in her mind and made her feel defeated, as if she was no longer the strong-willed warrior she prided herself to be.



After filming her first music video for “La Chacalosa,” the singer tells how three men in a white sports car chased her off a California highway. One of her attackers was a man whose advances she had rejected earlier in the night, and in the backseat of their car he raped her.

“I silently thanked God as I was slammed onto the sidewalk, realizing that it was finally over,” Rivera writes. “But the damage was done.”

The singer recalls feeling as if she was slowly being destroyed, but feared fighting back and ultimately leaving her children without a mother. Ashamed but relieved to be alive, Rivera vowed to never tell anyone of her ordeal.

But even amid the darkest moments of her life, there was light. In her book, Jenni reveals her one true love, Fernando -- the “Pinche Pelón” that stole her heart. Known as “El Corredor,” the diva’s love was a former promoter for the 'Que Buena de Los Angeles' radio station.

With him, Rivera says, she not only experienced her first orgasm -- at the age of 33 -- but also experimented with drugs, specifically marijuana. Still, Fernando’s drug addiction would eventually hinder the possibility of a happy ending, leading Rivera to eventually marry Esteban Loaiza instead.

In the 286 pages that the autobiography spans -- including photos and manuscripts -- the star also discusses in depth some of her most widely publicized experiences, including the moment she found out her first husband had raped her sister and eldest daughter.

“Unbreakable” (“Inquebrantable” in Spanish) was written by the singer herself over the course of several years in the form of a diary, with a final entry written six days before her tragic death on Dec. 9, 2012. The autobiography was released -- in both Spanish and English -- Tuesday, July 2, on what would’ve been Jenni’s 44th birthday.",1

The 17-year-old won with a score of 98.25 on her final run with China's Jiayu Liu taking silver and United States' Arielle Gold winning bronze.

Kim had already secured gold with her first run score but improved to win by eight-and-a-half points.

She is one of the stars of the Games and a favourite with the home fans due to her South Korean parents.

""It means a lot just being able to do it where my family is from,"" Kim said after her win which was watched by the biggest crowd so far at Pyeongchang's Phoenix Snow Park.

""There was a lot of pressure, but I'm happy I was able to do it here and do it for the fans and the family.

BBC Sport commentator Ed Leigh said we might be looking at ""the beginning of a very long reign for the queen of halfpipe snowboarding"".

The Californian was the strong favourite ahead of the Games and that status was strengthened when she qualified with a score of 91.50, almost four better than any of her rivals.

The gold is Kim's first Olympic medal at her debut Games. She qualified for the 2014 Games in Sochi but was unable to compete as she was aged just 13.

The teenager was the last to take to the course in the first run and immediately moved top of the standings with a score of 93.75.

She fell on her second run but no rider was able to better her initial effort meaning the American was already guaranteed gold before her final run.

Kim even took to Twitter during the competition to discuss her breakfast.

Her US team-mate and snowboard legend Shaun White qualified first in the men's halfpipe ahead of the final on Wednesday at 01:30 GMT.

Who is Pyeongchang's 'queen'?

Kim's victory was celebrated like a win for home nation South Korea at the snow park

Kim's parents emigrated from South Korea to the US in 1982 and she first tried the sport aged four.

Despite her age she has dominated the sport in recent years, becoming the youngest person to win three X Games gold medals.

At just 15 she became the first female snowboarder to land back-to-back 1080 degree spins in competition, a trick she repeated on her third run in Pyeongchang.

The teenager has a large following on social media and a tweet between her qualification runs went viral as she expressed her need for ice cream.

In her news conference following her win Kim said ""I'm so hungry. I really want a burger or fries or maybe some pizza"".

Thousands of Twitter users congratulated her following the win, causing her name to trend on the network.

There was more than double the number of tweets including her name in the hours after her win than those featuring her compatriots and fellow snowboard gold medal winners Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson combined after their wins earlier in the Games.

431,"Memorabilia From ‘The Challenge’ to be Auctioned Off In Honor of Diem Brown Fans of The Challenge are getting the opportunity to raid their favorite Challengers’ closets—all in the name of sweet charity!

On January 16, The Challenge Charity Auction will kick off on eBay, giving fans of the show a chance to bid on memorabilia from the show’s long history. The proceeds from the charity auction will benefit the charity Bright Pink, the only national non-profit focused on the prevention and early detection of breast and ovarian cancer in young women. As ‘Challenge’ fans know, Diem passed away from ovarian cancer in 2014.

Before her death, Diem was extremely dedicated to helping women learn the importance of early cancer detection. Diem made her ‘Challenge’ debut in 2006 on “Fresh Meat, and went on to compete in “The Duel,” “The Gauntlet,” “The Duel II,” “The Ruins,” “Battle of the Exes,” “Rivals II” and “Battle of the Exes II.” She passed away two months after filming ended for “Battle of the Exes II,” having received her third cancer diagnosis since her 2006 debut.

According to a press release for the charity auction, items being offered include signed game jerseys from the “Champs vs. Stars” and “Dirty 30” seasons. Challengers who donated to the auction include Johnny Bananas, Emily Schromm, Wes Bergmann, Terrell Owens, Justina Valentine, Tori Deal, and Diem’s ex-boyfriend CT Tamburello (to name just a few!)

The charity auction will also include Diem’s own jersey from 2008’s “The Gauntlet III.” (At press time Diem’s shirt had the highest bid at over $250!)

This is the second year in a row that a Challenge Charity Auction has been held. While promoting 2017’s auction, Johnny Bananas revealed why he continues to donate to the auctions.

“Every so often this banana takes a break from stirring the pot to use his powers for good,” he wrote on his website. “As you know, a while back we lost a true angel among us when Diem passed away. There’s not a day that I don’t think of her and what a loss that was. Grief is a tricky emotion and you never know when it’s going to rear its ugly head and drag you down. But instead of my grief becoming a void, I choose to use it as a ladder and pull myself up. The best way for me to lift my spirits is through work with charitable causes, and I can’t think of a more worthwhile cause than early detection of breast and ovarian cancer.”

In addition to signed shirts, The Challenge Charity Auction also includes a golden hand trophy given out during “The Challenge: Invasion of the Champions” Reunion special. Other fun items include several wooden signs that have been autographed by multiple ‘Challenge’ stars, and a banner from the “Dirty XXX” season that’s been autographed by the season’s whole cast

432,"How E! Is Remaking the People's Choice Awards for 2018 Brass at the cable giant hope a cross-portfolio push will bring an optimistic finish to an inarguably rough year for televised kudos.

Awards shows may still be among TV’s surest bets to lure a live audience, but fraught licensing negotiations and flagging ratings are dulling the sheen. A unique solution to those problems, however, is to skip the middleman altogether and buy one at a fire sale.

That’s what E! did in April of 2017, when Proctor & Gamble unloaded the People’s Choice Awards with the last of its TV properties. The 43-year-old populist celebration debuts at its new network with a new owner (NBCUniversal) on Nov. 11. Brass at the cable giant hope the unconventional move (and a cross-portfolio push) will bring an optimistic finish to an inarguably rough year for televised kudos.

“There wasn’t a year that went by that someone didn’t come in with a pitch for an original awards show,” says E! president Adam Stotsky, who long sought a tentpole event for his brand synonymous with red carpet coverage. “And when the rights for some of the smaller shows came up, it never made sense.”

NBCUniversal’s purchase, which is said to have set the company back a modest $8 million to $10 million, gives E! freedom to change the show to suit the celebrity-centric outlet without losing any of the built-in brand recognition. This year's event will be produced by Wilshire Studios and Den of Thieves with exec producers Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Prager. (For its final five years on CBS, the show averaged 8.2 million viewers and a 1.9 rating among adults 18-49 — numbers any cable network would salivate over.)

“This show fits in perfectly with what [NBCUniversal CEO] Steve Burke says about owning not renting,” says network EP of live events Jen Neal. Also E!'s executive vp marketing, Neal points to the social footprint of nominees as a major assist in getting the word out. Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds, The Avengers’ Chris Hemsworth and resident E! shills the Kardashians have been among the more vocal promoters thus far.

To be sure, 2018 has not been pretty for glitzy Hollywood telecasts. The main shows (the Emmys, Oscars, Globes and Grammys) lost a combined 15 million viewers from their year-ago telecasts. Concerns over that downward trajectory stalled deal renewals for both the Globes at NBC and the Emmys with the Big Four. NBCUniversal anticipates a calendar shift for People’s Choice, which traditionally aired in the middle of awards season, might help buck that trend — as could the decision to air it simultaneously on sister networks Syfy, USA, Bravo and NBC Universo, in addition to E!'s 160 international territories.

At least four marquee advertisers have been secured since the parent company's decision to make the show a point of emphasis during its Rockefeller Center pitch to media buyers in May. And, even if it's a flop, the fact that NBCUniversal now owns People's Choice in perpetuity offers a rare cushion in the awards space.

“We’ve built a huge business out of filming people walking through a parking lot, but we’ve never gone in the building,” adds Stotsky. “This is already a win for us.”

435,"Ben Affleck's summer of love: SNL producer Lindsay Shookus set to spend more time on West Coast They've been a public item for a year.

And the romance between Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus seems to be going from strength to as they enjoy summer together.

With the beautiful blonde on a break from Saturday Night Live, the 38-year-old producer is free to leave New York where it films and spend time with Ben in Los Angeles.

'Spending more time together': Ben Affleck is said to be 'very happy' that his lady love Lindsay Shookus can spend summer in L.A. now that SNL has finished filming, according to insiders

The Justice League star, 45 — who recently wrapped Netflix's Triple Frontier, in Hawaii — is fine with that.

'He's great,' a source told People in this week’s issue. 'He seems very happy that Lindsay is in L.A. now.'

Ben and Lindsay have recently been spotted out at restaurants together.

Walking the dogs: Ben, 48, joined Lindsay, 38, for a hike with their dogs and her parents, Christine and Robert Shookus, in the Santa Monica mountains on June 24

The couple dined at Capo in Santa Monica on Saturday night, as Ben escorted his lady love from the car to the restaurant with his arm around her.

They also enjoyed a meal at Italian eatery Felix Trattoria in nearby Venice on June 18.

And he took Lindsay's parents, Christine and Robert Shookus, out to Southeast Asian restaurant Cassia when they visited Ben's Los Angeles home later that week.

Lindsay is staying at Ben's $19 million mansion on and off, as well as her own place in L.A.

And although she will have to return to the East Coast once filming on SNL starts up, for now 'they’re enjoying doing normal couple things and exploring L.A. together,' one of Ben's pals dished to People.

Meanwhile, Ben has yet to introduce Lindsay to his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, who is the mother of his children Violet, 12, Seraphina, nine, and son Samuel, six.",1

The 33-year-old actress attended dinner with Foster and his daughters Sara, 36, and Erin, 35, Wednesday at Craig's restaurant in Los Angeles, according to Us Weekly.

Sources said McPhee and Foster ""spaced out"" their arrivals at the restaurant because ""they didn't want to draw attention to themselves."" E! News reported, however, that the pair left the establishment together.

""It was a really nice dinner,"" an insider said. ""Everyone was joking around and giving him a hard time about his age, but David was loving it.""

""[Katharine was] by his side the entire time,"" the source added. ""David and her were affectionate. He had his arm around her at times and they looked happy.""

Us Weekly reported in October that McPhee and Foster started seeing each other in the spring. The pair were spotted together in Malibu in May, and attended the Grammy Museum Gala together in September.

""David Foster and Katharine are hooking up and casually dating on the down low,"" a source said. ""They are just having fun right now, but they have such a good chemistry and really connect organically on so many levels.""

""There is potential for things to escalate in the future,"" the insider added. ""Erin and Sara are particularly fond of Katharine and think she is just the most wonderful person. They are totally team McFoster!""

439,"Amy Schumer weighs in on Aziz Ansari allegations Image copyright Getty Images

Amy Schumer has spoken out about sexual misconduct allegations against her friend and fellow comedian Aziz Ansari.

The Trainwreck star says she sympathises with the anonymous 22-year-old who recounted allegations of a date gone wrong with Aziz.

Amy, speaking on a US podcast, said many young women will have experience of being pressured into sex.

""In college I feel like that was a quarter of my hook-ups - they see what they can get out of you.""

""It's not a crime, but it's not cool"", the comedian, who was responding to allegations made in a babe.net interview, told the Katie Couric podcast.

'It's not like it's rape or it's fine'

The photographer alleged that Master of None star Aziz, 34, had pestered her for sex when the pair went back to his apartment after a date, claiming he failed to heed her verbal and non-verbal cues.

Aziz later issued a statement saying he had taken her allegations to heart, but thought the encounter was consensual.

The report polarised observers of the #metoo movement, provoking discussion about sexual etiquette and consent.

Schumer, whose comedy riffs on dating culture, told Couric: ""Everything doesn't have to be rape. It's not like 'it's rape, or it's fine.'

""I think some of us have gotten so used to the behaviour of a guy being kind of like 'come on' - at a younger age, especially.

""In college I feel like that was a quarter of my hook-ups - they see what they can get out of you.""

Amy said many wouldn't want to see Aziz lose his career, ""but that's where people's minds go"".

""They go 'does he deserve this'? And it's really not about that. I think it's about expressing and showing women that that behaviour's not okay and that not only can you leave, you need to leave.""

Schumer said Aziz's alleged behaviour was ""not a crime, but it's not cool and it can still really mess with a woman"".

""I identify with all the women in these situations,"" she says.

""Even if it's my friend I don't go 'oh but he's a good guy'. I think 'what would it feel like to have been her?'""

Kim Kardashian and her family recently taped an upcoming episode of “Family Feud,” hosted by Steve Harvey. Unsurprisingly, Kardashian’s appearance on the TV game show has touched off feuding even before it airs.

Harvey told Ellen DeGeneres a few weeks ago that Kardashian “didn’t know nothing” on the show, and praised Kardashian’s husband, rapper Kanye West, as “the best ‘Family Feud’ celebrity panelist we’ve ever had on the show.”

In a new interview with DeGeneres, Kardashian said she’s “confused” by Harvey’s claims, considering she’s been a “Family Feud” fan forever.

“You don’t understand ― When I used to work in my dad’s office as a teenager, I used to sit and not do my work, and play ‘Family Feud’ online,” Kardashian said on Monday’s episode of “Ellen.”

“That was my thing. I’m good at it,” she added.

But as DeGeneres pointed out, that’s not what Harvey said.

“I don’t think I got one answer, and it was a legitimate answer,” Kardashian said, smiling. “I feel like the more I talk about it, I get so angry.”

She then repeated that she’s “really, really good” at the game show and that Harvey’s words were odd.

“I don’t know if he was trying to be funny or what, so I was confused by his response to me,” she said.

Kardashian also addressed allegations that Tristan Thompson has been cheating on her sister, Khloe. The NBA player was caught on videos with other women in the months leading up to the birth of his first child with Khloe in April.

“Poor Khloe,” the reality TV star told DeGeneres. “I don’t even know how to describe it besides it’s just so fucked up.”",1

The girlfriends, wives and fiancées of the biggest names in rap have come together for The Platinum Life, a new reality series on E! that will showcase their lives in the spotlight.

A few of the ladies recently invited ET to experience the ""VIP lifestyle"" with them at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, where Nelly, who is dating one of the gals, was performing. From their favorite perks to the crazy drama, Shantel Jackson, Asiah Collins and Alycia Bella tease what fans can expect from their all-new show.

Shantel Jackson

E!

She's sweet, confident and an all-around awesome support system for her boyfriend, Nelly, whom she's been dating for three and a half years. While chatting with ET, Shantel recalled the exact moment she and Nelly met, and the qualities she loves about him.

""Nelly and I actually met through a mutual friend of ours and I was so honestly hell-bent on, 'No, I don't think I want to get into another relationship right now or date another celebrity,'"" said Shantel, who previously dated Floyd Mayweather. ""He kept pressing our mutual friend like, 'Just tell her to come chill with me at the studio, I just want to meet her.' I ended up just giving in one day, and honestly, we've been inseparable ever since.""

""I'm always proud of him,"" she continued. ""I love the way he treats his family, he takes care of his mother, he takes care of his father. Family is really important to him and it's really important to me as well. We're also both adventurous, outdoorsy. He makes me laugh, which is really important. We can be around each other non-stop and not be at each other’s throats like, 'Oh my gosh, I gotta get away from you.' I really enjoy that… I enjoy his company.""

When she's not by Nelly's side, Shantel loves hanging out with her girlfriends and working on her own business ventures. She tells ET that the show will be a mix of all the glitz and glamour, the partying, the drama and an inside look at what goes on behind the scenes.

""All of that is our lives,"" she explained. ""We do party, we do get to see the concerts that we want to see, we get to watch our men perform. Of course, we are around these other women in the circle and all of us are not going to agree on everything -- [it's natural] to bump heads with someone along the lines and that’s real life.""

""But even if we're in disagreements one day, I think we still find common ground,"" she added. ""We respect each other enough to not have to throw drinks or throw hands. Keep it cute, classy and catty.""

Asiah Collins

E!

Kid Ink's wife has been with the rapper since they were just ""young, broke kids"" in high school -- their first date was a trip to the movies followed by $3 sushi! -- but after all this time together, there's nothing Asiah loves more than being his ""Main Chick.""

""I feel like the only girl in the world, to be honest,"" she gushed. ""He's very good at making me feel like I'm the only chick that matters.""

And while she doesn't mind being known as Ink's wife, Asiah's excited for fans to see a different side of her on the show, which premieres on the couple's one-year wedding anniversary. In addition to supporting her husband, Asiah keeps busy by raising their 1-year-old daughter, Aislin, and working on her own dreams.

""Oh my God, I'm still trying to figure that out,"" Asiah said, when asked how she balances it all in this industry. ""Sometimes it gets really tricky, but most of the time it's just about having a really good support system.""

""But I'm excited for fans to learn that I do have a brain and a personality and I'm out here making moves,"" she added. ""Also, just more about the roles that I play on tour, helping Ink out. I'm not only there to be a pretty face -- I'm actually contributing to the tour, handling the merch, etc. Anything he needs me to do, I'll do it. It doesn't matter what it is.""

Asiah confirmed her and Ink's baby girl will make a few appearances on the show. She says their lives have changed drastically since welcoming a child, and fans will get to see a part of that world.

""You have to keep it fresh,"" she said of how she and Ink have made it work all these years. ""We both get so busy, and having a toddler now as well, it's just knowing that you don't always have the proper time to be intimate. So, you just get it in when you can and how you can. We also plan date nights. Every Wednesday night we'll go somewhere, just the two of us.""

Although they seemingly have their hands full already, Asiah said she and Ink are currently ""trying"" for another kid.

""I have it on my mind. I've mapped it out to wait until after my 30th birthday next year,"" Asiah, who celebrated her 29th birthday on the day of our interview, revealed. ""So, the plan is in a year to get knocked up the night of my 30th birthday. But we've both been feeling the fever a lot lately. So, we'll see if we last that long.""

Alycia Bella

E!

When filming began for The Platinum Life, Alycia had just gotten out of a long-term relationship with Ty Dolla $ign (who is now dating Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui). After calling it quits from the ""Paranoid"" rapper, Alycia is ready to show the world what it's like to hold her own as the single girl in the group.

""When it comes to love, I feel like it's just something that happens -- you don't try, you don't force it,"" she said. ""I'm not feeling like I need a man at the moment. I'm off men right now! I'm cool without a guy and just focusing on me.""

""I definitely probably share, like, five percent of what really happened in our relationship just out of respect for something that I feel is so real to me, and that was a part of my life for the past 10 years,"" she continued. ""It's so layered and you can't really tell a full story in sound bites. So, more so, you'll see me coming to find myself again and being able to hear my own voice again.""

She said this newfound attitude is all thanks to the support of the girls, who helped her remember what it was like to have a voice.

""They made me realize like, 'Wow, you were Alycia before you were tied to a famous guy. You have your own dreams and ambitions and goals,'"" she explained. ""So, I think you watch me getting back to me, and that was honestly an experience in itself that I'm so appreciative of.""

""I felt like this show is exactly what I was asking for,"" she added. ""I've been wanting my voice to be heard, I've been wanting to inspire other women that maybe have been in a situation like the one I've been in. I think that the message for women to feel empowered and strong by themselves is so important. And that I have insecurities, too. The Platinum Life doesn't mean you have it all together.""

Eric Bellinger's wife, La'Myia Good, King Los' girlfriend, LoLa Monroe, Miguel's fiancée, Nazanin Mandi, and Ne-Yo's wife, Crystal Smith, also star in The Platinum Life, premiering Sunday, Oct. 15 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on E!",1
442,"John Mayer Defends Justin Bieber For Canceling 'Purpose' Tour, Proves They're BFFs Just when you thought John Mayer was all about being a lone wolf, he proves to be the most supportive friend... ever. John Mayer defended Justin Bieber and his decision to cancel the remainder of his Purpose World Tour during a recent interview with Variety, and it was so, so sweet. The ""Who You Love"" singer is known for being deep, sensitive, and sometimes not making sense when talking about Katy Perry during interviews. However, he made it known loud and clear that he supports Bieber's decision, and that we should, too. He said,

With touring dates, you hope you do them all, and I don't know his situation, but I appreciate the transparency. There are a hundred different reasons you can give for canceling a tour. I think the one that goes, 'I think I'm done' is the bravest and healthiest one.

If John Mayer says it, it must be true. AMIRITE? Mayer continued,

You can't send someone else to do the gig; you've got to do it. And at that age — I'm 39 and only now beginning to feel like I can weather the storm. You have to apply a certain amount of grace to younger people who are developing into that.

Mayer has been vocal about his support of Bieber's decision since the beginning. After it was announced that Bieber was canceling the remainder of the Purpose World Tour on July 24, he received a lot of backlash. He also got tons of support from fans worried about the ""Love Yourself"" singer's well-being, including John Mayer.

Mayer tweeted,

When someone pulls remaining dates of a tour, it means they would have done real damage to themselves if they kept going. We've lost so many great artists lately. I give Justin [two thumbs up] for realizing it was time to call it. You should too.

The news of the canceled tour took a lot of people by surprise because Bieber had less than 20 shows left at the tail-end of an 18-month tour. In a statement to Elite Daily, Bieber's team said,

Due to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over the last 18 months. He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six contents during this run. However, after careful consideration, he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.

One day, we may know the true reasoning behind Bieber canceling the rest of his tour. For now, we should all take note from John Mayer and give Biebs a break.",1
443,"Paris Hilton 'sorry' for defending Trump's comments Paris Hilton has issued a public apology for claiming President Trump's sexual harassment accusers were just vying for 'attention and fame'.

In a statement released to US Weekly, the socialite, 36, insisted her comments were taken out of context, and promised to 'provide a louder voice for those who may desperately need it' going forward.

'I want to apologize for my comments from an interview I did last year,' Paris said. 'They were part of a much larger story and I am regretful that they were not delivered in the way I had intended.

'Deeply hurt': Paris Hilton has issued a public apology for claiming President Trump's sexual harassment accusers were just vying for 'attention and fame'

'I was speaking about my own experiences in life and the role of media and fame in our society and it was never my intention for my comments to be misapplied almost a year later.'

The celebrity DJ issued an apology amid a mounting public backlash after her comments were published in the September issue of Marie Claire.

In the interview, which the Hilton hotel heiress gave in November, she slammed 'opportunists' who accused then-candidate Trump, 71, of sexual harassment.

'I think that they are just trying to get attention and fame,' she told the magazine.

Controversial: In the interview, which the Hilton hotel heiress, 36, gave in November, she slammed 'opportunists' who accused then-candidate Trump, 71, of sexual harassment

Paris Hilton's apology 'I want to apologize for my comments from an interview I did last year. 'They were part of a much larger story and I am regretful that they were not delivered in the way I had intended. 'I was speaking about my own experiences in life and the role of media and fame in our society and it was never my intention for my comments to be misapplied almost a year later. 'I always believe in helping women have their voices heard and helping create an environment where women feel empowered and believe in themselves. 'I am deeply hurt by how this has played out and also deeply sorry. 'Moving forward I will continue to do what I can to be an advocate for girls and women with the hopes of providing a louder voice for those who may desperately need it.

'I feel like, a lot of people, when something happens, all these opportunists will come out.

'They want to get money or get paid to not say anything or get a settlement when nothing really happened. So I don't believe any of that.'

Insisting she is a feminist as she issued a public apology over the matter, Paris said she was 'deeply hurt' by the furor over her controversial comments, and promised to 'be an advocate for girls and women'.

She said: 'I always believe in helping women have their voices heard and helping create an environment where women feel empowered and believe in themselves.

'I am deeply hurt by how this has played out and also deeply sorry.

'Moving forward I will continue to do what I can to be an advocate for girls and women with the hopes of providing a louder voice for those who may desperately need it.'

In the Marie Claire interview, Paris refuted reports she voted for Trump, saying she didn't vote for anyone during the last election.

They go way back: Paris has a history with Trump, an old family friend, whom she calls 'an incredible businessman' and a good president (pictured with sister Nicky in 2001)

But she admitted she thinks the politician, an old family friend, is 'charming' and 'good looking' - and thinks his accusers thought so too.

'I'm sure that they were trying to be with him, too,' she said. 'Because a lot of women, I've seen, like him because he's wealthy and he's charming and good-looking so I feel like a lot of these girls just made the story up.'

Multiple women have come forward to accuse the President of sexual harassment in the past year.

They include former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, who filed a lawsuit in January alleging the President used his platform to falsely denigrate her and other women who accused him of 'unwanted sexual touching'.

Before the election, she accused the billionaire of inappropriate sexual advances, including groping her, when she met him at the Beverly Hills Hotel to seek career advice. However, she didn't file a lawsuit at the time.

Backlash: The socialite insisted her comments were taken out of context, and promised to 'provide a louder voice for those who may desperately need it' going forward

Zervos only came forward after the release of the outtake of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape where Trump brags to Billy Bush about grabbing women by their sexual organs.

'Grab them by the p****,' he told Bush. 'You can do anything. When you're a star, they let you do it.'

Trump later claimed that the conversation with Bush was 'locker room talk' and denied actual sexual misconduct.

Other accusers included a pageant queen who claimed Trump groped her in 2006, and a People reporter who claimed Trump forcibly kissed her without her consent during an interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in 2005.

Zervos' attorney Gloria Allred stated that after Trump was accused by several other women of sexual misconduct, he 'knowingly, intentionally, and maliciously threw each of these women under the bus', and repeatedly called them 'liars'.

In the interview, Paris brushed off Trump's lewd comments as typical guy talk.

'I've heard guys say some pretty crazy things. Like, worse than that,' she said.

One of his victims: Summer Zervos, a former contestant on the fifth season of The Apprentice, accused Trump of groping her during a meeting at the Beverly Hills Hotel

'I think it was kind of just one of those things where you're with someone — I've heard guys say the craziest things ever 'cuz I'm always around guys and I listen to them speak. So I definitely don't think he would just say that.'

Paris has a history with Trump, an old family friend, whom she calls 'an incredible businessman' and a good president.

Trump previously admitted watching Hilton's notorious sex tape, and once described the first time he met a then 12-year-old Paris who he thought was 'beautiful.'

'I've known Paris Hilton from the time she's 12,' Trump told Howard Stern when he appeared on his radio show. 'Her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her, she walked into the room and I said, ""Who the hell is that?""

'At 12, I wasn't interested. I've never been into that … but she was beautiful.'

When confronted whether such revelations 'creeped' her out, Paris blamed Trump's answers on Stern.

'I feel that anyone that's on that show, Howard just loves to say weird things and people say things that they normally wouldn't say,' she said. 'It wasn't creepy at all. He's not like that at all, he's always been so respectful.'",1

'And from her infusion gained a 50 percent share in the company.'

Instead, Rob is requesting he receive $2,864 a month from his 30-year-old ex-fiancée (born Angela White) since she allegedly has over $1.4M banked and they share 50/50 custody of Dream.

Jan. 16, 2018, 4:01 PM UTC / Source: TODAY By Eun Kyung Kim

Four-year-old Prince George may be ahead of his little sister Princess Charlotte in line for the throne, but she’s clearly the ruler at home.

That's according to their great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who noted the power balance between the young royal siblings during a meeting on Sunday at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. The queen was presenting a Bible she signed to a 10-year-old student who won a contest for the best religious studies project at her school when the funny exchange took place.

The 91-year-old monarch asked the student if she “looked after” her younger sister. The girl’s mom jumped in saying: “It’s the other way around,"" according to the Daily Mail.

The queen replied, “It’s like that with Charlotte and George,” noting how the 2-year-old princess keeps a watchful eye over her older brother, the prince.

Bossy Princess Charlotte? Quite so, says Queen Elizabeth! The Duchess of Cambridge / EPA

According to the father of the lucky student, who won the same prize as his daughter in 1990, Charlotte's inclination to watch over her older brother is typical sibling behavior.

""It is often the case that a younger child is more confident,"" he said at the event. ""It is second child syndrome.""

This shouldn’t be a complete shocker for royal family fans. Last year, the Duchess of Cambridge reportedly told a fellow mom that her daughter Charlotte was “the one in charge” at home.

And last fall, Prince William The Duke of Cambridge, her father, joked that his daughter is “going to be trouble when she gets older.”

The young princess, who recently started nursery school, will get plenty of chances to look after her big brother when their parents head to Sweden and Norway for a four-day visit later this month.",1

The dresses, captured in Brides ' exclusive photos of the epic event , were beyond beautiful and we weren't the only ones who thought so. The groom himself was similarly stunned by his bride's fashionable frocks—particularly the second wedding dress that Upton slipped into for the after-party, which provoked a red-hot reaction from Justin Verlander!

“I knew she was doing a change, but didn’t know what it was,” Verlander told Us Weekly of Upton's sexy slip. “The second I saw her in that, I was like, ‘OK, time to go. Let’s get out of here. Wedding over!” Upton's sizzling second wedding dress was an embellished Christy Rilling Studio gown. ""I wanted a dress that I could have fun in but that still brought the glamour,"" Upton said of the sultry look .

Before pulling out Dress #2 (and rousing that reaction from her new husband!), Upton wore another gorgeous gown for the ceremony at the picturesque Rosewood Castiglion Del Bosco. The model's first wedding dress was crafted out of feminine lace and tulle by the team at Valentino. “The design process was extremely collaborative, so I could create my dream dress ,” said Upton. “And their Italian heritage kept the fashion authentic to our venue.”

451,"""Queer Eye"" and ""Nailed It!"" Crossover Episode Is A Fabulous Mess There’s no arguing that Queer Eye and Nailed It! bring some of the *most* delight to Netflix viewers — because come on, what’s better than makeovers and baking??

There’s nothing more heartwarming than watching the Fab Five transform people’s lives for the better, and there’s also nothing funnier than witnessing frustrated bakers’ desperate attempt to recreate complicated cakes and pastries. Perhaps the only thing that would make both shows better is if they joined forces — and because Netflix is Netflix, the streaming site offered us the crossover episode we never even knew we needed.

Yep, a Queer Eye and Nailed It! crossover episode exists, released with the second season of the latter, and I don’t know about you, but it’s the most ambitious crossover event in HISTORY. (No offense, Infinity War.)

Can you believe?!

In the episode, our BFFs Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, Bobby Berk, and Karamo Brown visit the Nailed It! kitchen for a fabulous baking challenge. The guys, with the exception of Antoni (as he is tasked by host Nicole Byer and chocolatier Jacques Torres to be the guest judge) try to recreate fondant versions of themselves, and well…let’s just say that they’re better off revamping houses and putting together outfits.

“The kitchen is my sunken place,” culture expert Karamo says at one point, to which Byer responded, “Don’t be a black man giving up in front of America!”

We don’t want to spoil anything, so we won’t tell you who wins, but we’ll tell you this: It is NOT Jonathan, because his finished cupcake of Tan is a complete MESS.

I’m sorry, henny, but that does not resemble a cupcake AT ALL.

Trust us when we say that the Queer Eye x Nailed It! crossover event is the best 12 minutes you’ll watch today. You may stream the whole episode on Netflix here or the shorter version on YouTube here.

Hey, Netflix, it if isn’t too much to ask, can we have an entire season of this? We’re pretty sure we’ll have no problem watching the Fab Five banter with Nicole and nail it for hours on end.",1

454,"‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ Season 3 Finally Used the Word ‘Rape’: Why It’s a Big Deal Tina Fey and Robert Carlock's complicated Netflix comedy took a big swing with an offhand joke, but reminded us just how important this character's journey is.

[Editor’s note: Spoilers for Season 3 of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” follow.]

The most important, intriguing, and controversial moment of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” Season 3 happens so fast that you might have missed it: In Episode 3, “Kimmy Can’t Help You!,” Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) finally uses the word “rape” in reference to her 15 years spent stuck underground as the prisoner of Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm).

READ MORE: ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ Season 3 Review: Kimmy Goes to College, Tackles the Patriarchy, and Gets Stronger

Specifically, here’s what happens: Wendy (very special guest star Laura Dern) has come to Kimmy and Titus’s apartment with a set of divorce papers, as she and the Reverend are hoping to get married, but Kimmy and the Reverend are still legally man and wife.

Wendy doesn’t reveal right away that she’s hoping to marry the Reverend, but quickly we discover that this otherwise normal-seeming woman has, at the very least, a very poor understanding of what kind of monster “Richard” is, something that pisses Kimmy off — and may be why she (and the show) crossed a line they’ve up until now avoided.

“It’s kind of sophisticated, if you think about it,” Wendy practically giggles. “An evening in Manhattan with my lover’s wife. It sounds like a Noel Coward play.”

Snaps Kimmy in reply: “If Noel Coward was really a coward who rapes everybody.”

From the beginning of the series, creators Tina Fey and Robert Carlock have hinted at some of the darker elements of Kimmy’s abduction and imprisonment, most notably with this line in the pilot: “Yes, there was weird sex stuff in the bunker.” Otherwise, the show has shown a preference for show over tell, specifically in how Kimmy’s trauma interferes with her attempts to pursue any sort of romantic relationship.

Kimmy’s love interests have included several nice gentlemen over the past three seasons, such as tutor Charles (Andrew Ridings), rich guy Logan (Adam Campbell), Vietnamese immigrant Dong (Ki Hong Lee), PTSD-afflicted veteran Keith (Sam Page), and this season, the lovely Daveed Diggs as philosophy student Perry. All of them have initially seemed like a potential fit for Kimmy, and all of them haven’t worked out – much of the time because when she finds herself in an intimate situation, Kimmy’s instinctual reaction is to lash out with violence in order to protect herself.

At times, Kimmy’s over-the-top physical reaction to these moments is played for comedy, to a degree where it’s a bit uncomfortable to watch her constantly slamming telephones on Dong’s head as he attempts to kiss her.

And of all her love interests, Dong is the one she’s gone furthest with. While they struggle to connect in Season 2 Episode 8, “Kimmy Goes To A Hotel,” the final scene indicates that as they’re trapped in the back of a police car, Kimmy finally feels capable of pursuing more with him. “You’re in handcuffs, which is making my brain feel calm for more totally normal reasons…” she says. “It’s never going to be perfect.”

That last comment feels like a nice overall statement for what life is like as a survivor of trauma, and “Kimmy Schmidt” has always been sure to keep an element of humanity in its exploration of what Kimmy’s time in the bunker did to her as a person. It’s also one of the trickiest hurdles the show has had to navigate, because the established tone of a light, bubbly comedy about a woman who now fully admits to over a decade of rape and abuse is at times a real brain-teaser.

One interesting twist came in Season 3, Episode 11, “Kimmy Googles the Internet!” — in which Kimmy learned that many of the people in her life are more than aware of her mole woman past, thanks to Google. It’s a harsh moment of awareness for the character, as her relative naïveté when it comes to technology has kept her shielded from the fact that so much of our lives can be hunted down with some strategic search engine terms.

But it also led to a character arc that honestly felt a little formless, but still intriguing. Season 1 was about Kimmy confronting what, exactly, happened to her. Season 2 was about acknowledging she needed help and getting it. But Season 3 was about her working to own that experience, rather than hide it.

And a big part of that? Finally using the “R-word.” It’s unlikely that “Kimmy Schmidt” will ever push past a PG-13 rating, despite its subject matter and Netflix’s loose content restrictions — Tina Fey has said that she likes that families can still watch the show together. But now that the show is slightly more comfortable with being honest about what happened to Kimmy, maybe she, and the show, can actually move on in a real, healthy way.

“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” has done a lovely job over the past three seasons of creating its own little world. There’s plenty to explore still as Kimmy fills her Google results with what she does now — not so much burying what was done to her, but proving that as a female who’s “strong as hell,” she’s far more than that one experience.

“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” Season 3 is streaming now on Netflix.

The Don’t Be Tardy star revealed Wednesday that she’s planning to get smaller breast implants after she asked her fans to cast their votes in a poll on what size they think she should reduce to.

“Which one,” Zolciak-Biermann, 40, wrote in an Instagram Story with two implant size options: “Full C [or] DD.”

Image zoom Kim Zolciack Biermann/Instagram

“Thx @kanebiermann for taking this pic of me today!!” the mother of six captioned a photo — snapped by her 4-year-old son, Kane — of herself wearing a strapless red bikini while standing beside a swimming pool.

“Lopsided boobs and all (clearly it’s the bathing suit lol) 😂🤣” she wrote. “But thanks you guys for voting on C/DD can’t wait to downsize a little @dr.hochstein 💃🏼💃🏼”



During her House of Kim podcast on Wednesday, Zolciak-Biermann opened up about her decision to go smaller.

“I obviously have implants. I have the largest implants they actually make, but it doesn’t look that big on my body because of just the way I’m built,” she shared. “But, I’m thinking about actually getting my boobs reduced.”

“I already called Dr. Hochstein, who did my boobs and tummy a few years ago — he did my hernia repair and my tummy tuck after that, you might as well! And I said, ‘You know, I feel like I should get my boobs reduced. They’re heavy, my posture’s terrible, I’m getting older.’ What do you guys think?”

“I was thinking of going from like a DD to like a C. So head on over to my Instagram please and vote: DD or C,” she said. “I’ve actually already had my surgery scheduled in a couple months, but I can always change that.”

“I had a lift and I have like the nicest boobs ever. I did breastfeed all of my kids, so ladies, let’s be honest, they were stretched out, loss of volume, pancake nipples,” she explained. “So [Dr. Hochstein] gave me back my 18-year-old chest, which was amazing. He’s the best for that you guys.”

“So anyways, let me know. I’m thinking like a C, a full C. I have to have all my clothes altered. I have to buy a size 6 in everything when I could wear a size 2 in tops because of my boobs and then have everything altered. So it’d be nice to just be able to wear something. They’re perky because I had a lift, so it’s not really that, it’s just the weight of them,” said Zolciak-Biermann

RELATED VIDEO: Kelly Dodd Opens Up About Cosmetic Procedures: “No Pain, No Gain!”

The Bravo star has been very open about her relationship with plastic surgery in the past, including documenting her breast augmentation on her Bravo reality show.

“I will always nip and tuck if I feel the need to do so” Zolciak-Biermann told E! News in 2016. “I’m open about it. I don’t care. You only go around one time, and I especially understand that.”

“I had a boob job and I’ve had a hernia fixed,” Zolciak-Biermann explained. “I had a pretty big hernia from the twins, so I said just do a tummy tuck, which is kinda the same thing, just make the skin really tight. But that doesn’t change my size. I’m the same size I was the day I walked into surgery, I’m just a little bit tighter looking.”

At the time, she also explained that her tiny frame runs in the family.

“A lot is genetics,” she said. “My mom’s very small, I’m tall, I’m 5-8, I do have height on me. My mom is 5-4. But my mom’s been a size 2 her whole life. I’ve been a size 27 jean my whole life.”",1
456,"All About ‘Smallville’ Actress Allison Mack Role in Sex Cult Allison Mack. Photo: Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images

Allison Mack first achieved fame in the early aughts, when she was cast as an original character on the TV series Smallville; the second time her name started popping up in the news with increasing frequency was in April 2018, when she was arrested by the FBI for her suspected involvement in NXIVM, an organization that allegedly brainwashed, manipulated, and blackmailed women into being “sex slaves.”

In the past year, the emerging details surrounding the case — many of which have involved Mack — have only only grown increasingly disturbing, including allegations that she recruited women to be “sex slaves” in an internal secret society, where she branded them with founder Keith Raniere’s initials and blackmailed them. Most recently, on April 8, Mack tearfully pleaded guilty to one charge of racketeering conspiracy and and charge of racketeering in Brooklyn federal court.

Below, here’s everything you need to know about Allison Mack’s involvement.

First things first: How do you say “NXIVM”?

It’s pronounced “Nexium.”

And what exactly is it?

It’s an Albany-based cult with connections all over the world that reportedly masquerades as a “self-help” organization meant to empower women. It was thrust into the spotlight in October 2017, when a New York Times investigation found that the women who were involved were referred to as “slaves,” and subject to ritual humiliations and brandings. They were also allegedly told to starve themselves to achieve founder Keith Raniere’s standard of beauty and to have sexual encounters with him. (In late March 2018, Raniere was arrested and charged with sex trafficking, and has since been charged with child pornography.)

How did Mack get involved?

﻿According to the New York Post, Mack’s Smallville co-star, Kristin Kreuk, introduced Mack to NXIVM in 2006. While Kreuk admitted that she was involved with the sex cult, she claims that her involvement predated the ritual brandings and other humiliating practices to which the cult subjected women. “The accusations that I was in the ‘inner circle’ or recruited women as ‘sex slaves’ are blatantly false,” Kreuk said on Twitter.

In an interview Mack gave with Times reporter Vanessa Grigoriadis six months before her arrest, she claimed that she came up with practice of cauterizing the flesh of “sex slaves” in the NXIVM secret society, DOS.

What are Mack’s charges?

She was initially charged with sex trafficking and forced labor charges, which could’ve led to life in jail. In Brooklyn court on April 20, 2018, assistant U.S. attorney Moira Penza said, “Ms. Mack was one of the top members of a highly organized scheme which was designed to provide sex to [Raniere]. Under the guise of female empowerment, she starved women until they fit her co-defendant’s sexual feminine ideal.” During that court appearance, Mack pleaded not guilty.

Nearly a year later, though, Mack changed her plea. On April 8, she pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of racketeering, and fully admitted to the allegations against her: that she was a member of DOS, and that she had attempted to recruit other women into the group. She also confessed that she forced women in DOS to hand over embarrassing information about themselves, known as “collateral,” so that she could blackmail them were they to not act accordingly to her or Raniere’s orders.

“I have come to the conclusion that I must take full responsibility for my conduct, and that’s why I am pleading guilty today,” she said. “I’m very sorry for the victims of this case.”

So what’s next for Mack?

On April 8, Mack’s sentencing was set for September 11. She is facing up to 40 years in prison.",1

In the exclusive clip above, the reality star makes out with fellow contestant Camila Nakagawa on the back of the cast bus as they make their way back to their Cartagena, Colombia, house after a night out.

“What are you doing, Tony?!” Cara Maria Sobello says in the clip. “You’re the one with the mom and the kid at home and this is what you’re gonna do on national television?”

Raines has had his fair share of scandals on and off the show after also cheating on his Real World costar Madison Walls-Channing while on his first season of The Challenge in 2015. Walls-Channing found out she was pregnant with Raines’ child shortly after they broke up and gave birth to his first daughter, 16-month-old Harper.

The reality star is also parent to 9-month-old Isla Rose with high school sweetheart Alyssa Giacone — his “skeleton” that came back to haunt him during his stay in the Real World house. Raines was still dating Giacone when he shot this season of The Challenge, but it seems the two may have broken up after rumors of his hookup with Nakagawa.

459,"Priyanka Chopra is all set for Meghan Markle’s royal wedding and here are pics of her prep While the entire world will have eyes set on Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on Saturday, desis back home will be rooting for someone else at the royal wedding. Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra is in London and is ready to watch her friend walk down the aisle.

The actor reached London ahead of the royal wedding wearing a plaid pantsuit. Priyanka had earlier confessed that she was “stressed out about [wearing] a small hat” but a visit to iconic British fascinator designer Philip Treacy put her mind to rest. Ohhhh, now I get it !!” the 35-year-old actor shared a photo as she is surrounded by fascinator designs. Her makeup artist Patrick Ta also reached London and shared an Instagram photo, giving us a broad hint that he will be creating Priyanka’s makeup look for Meghan Markle’s wedding.

Welcomed by the UK sun... #nomakeupnofilter A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on May 18, 2018 at 11:58am PDT

Priyanka will be one of the very few Indian faces present at the wedding and those who don’t know about her friendship with the to-be princess might be wondering about the connection. To clear all doubt, here’s a quick revision for you on how they met, what they have said about each other and more.

The Bollywood star and the American actor first met in January 2016 at Elle’s 6th Annual Women in TV Celebration. They met at the party which was also attended by Viola Davis, Olivia Wilde and more. The two hit it off instantly. “We bonded as actors. We just became friends, like two girls would,” Priyanka told People magazine in 2017.

Meghan then interviewed Priyanka for her now-defunct lifestyle blog, The Tig. Soon, they became good friends and started hanging out regularly. They watched Hamilton together, enjoyed drinks by swimming pools in Malibu and clicked a lot of selfies. While a few pictures from this phase can still be found online on Priyanka’s Instagram, others were lost when Meghan’s Instagram profile was deactivated after she got engaged to Prince Harry in November 2017.

Before the engagement was announced and when Harry and Meghan were being spotted together by the paparazzi, even Priyanka started getting bombarded by curious questions about her friend and her prince. In May 2017, she was asked by Wendy Williams on her show about ‘Prince Harry’s girlfriend,’ Priyanka didn’t hesitate in correcting her: “Also, Meghan Markle: actress, Suits, her achievements,” a gesture appreciated by both the actors’ fans.

The love, however, has not been one-sided. Meghan also talked about Priyanka with PTI in an interview. “I would love to work with her on a film one day! I told her specifically that my dream is to work with her on a Bollywood film, because I think it would be so much fun — she said I should do it,” she had said.

Priyanka also recently wrote a piece on Meghan for Time magazine as she featured in their list of 100 Most Influential and called her a ‘princess for the people.’ Here’s the full text:

Somewhere among biryani, poutine and endless conversations, I realized just how deeply Meghan Markle cares for the world. With her, what you see is real, and what you get is a relatable young woman with her heart and mind in the right place. Her compassion, evident in the causes she supports, and her drive to break down stereotypes—obvious in her actions—will connect her to a generation in much need of kindness.

This ever-smiling, strong free spirit found her prince, fell in love and in turn made a cynical world believe in fairy tales again. But more than anything else, Meghan is an important influencer in a world that needs strong public figures to respect and look up to. People the world can be inspired by. Meghan, standing shoulder to shoulder with Harry, will be a princess for the people.

Love always, my friend. Live happily ever after.

Priyanka was again asked about Meghan on The View, Good Morning America and What Happens Live With Andy Cohen earlier this month as she promoted her show, Quantico. She was asked about what she would wear, the gift she had chosen, if she had met Prince Harry or if she knows with Meghan cried when she saw her wedding dress. Priyanka, like a true friend gave nothing away.

Guess, we will have to wait just a few more hours to find that out with the world.

460,"Tonya Harding Retired American figure skater

This article is about the American figure skater. For the Australian softball player, see Tanya Harding

Tonya Maxene Price[2] (née Harding; born November 12, 1970) is an American former figure skater, retired boxer, and reality television personality.

A native of Portland, Oregon, Harding was raised primarily by her mother, who enrolled her in ice skating lessons beginning at age four. Harding would spend much of her early life training, eventually dropping out of high school to devote her time to the sport. After climbing the ranks in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 Skate America competition. She was the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion before being stripped of her 1994 title, and 1991 World silver medalist. In 1991, she earned distinction as being the first American woman to successfully land a triple Axel in competition, and the second woman to do so in history (behind Midori Ito). She is also a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.

In January 1994, Harding became embroiled in controversy when her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, orchestrated an attack on her fellow U.S. skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. Both women then competed in the February 1994 Winter Olympics, where Kerrigan won the silver medal and Harding finished eighth. Harding later pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution in March and was banned for life on June 30, 1994 from the U.S. Figure Skating Association.

In the early 2000s, Harding competed as a professional boxer, and her life has been the subject of numerous films, documentaries, books, and academic studies. In 2014, two television documentaries about Harding's life and skating career (Nancy & Tonya and The Price of Gold) were aired within two months of each other — inspiring Steven Rogers to write the darkly comedic biographical film I, Tonya, released in 2017 and starring Margot Robbie as Harding. In 2018 Harding was a contestant on season 26 of Dancing with the Stars, finishing in third place.

Early life [ edit ]

Ice Chalet at Portland's Lloyd Center , where Harding began skating at age four

Tonya Maxene Harding was born on November 12, 1970, in Portland, Oregon, to LaVona Golden (b. 1940)[3] and Albert Harding (1933–2009).[4] She was raised in East Portland and began skating at age three, training with coach Diane Rawlinson. During her youth, Harding also hunted, drag raced, and learned automotive mechanics from her father. He held various odd jobs including managing apartments, driving a truck, and working at a bait-and-tackle store – yet was often underemployed due to poor health.[5] LaVona struggled to support the family while working as a waitress, and hand-sewed her daughter's skating costumes as they could not afford to purchase them.[6] Harding's parents divorced after 19 years of marriage in 1987, when she was 16 years old.[7] She later dropped out of Milwaukie High School during her sophomore year in order to focus on skating, and earned a General Equivalency Diploma in 1988.

According to Harding, she was frequently abused by her mother. She stated that by the time she was seven years old, physical and psychological abuse had both become a regular part of her life. LaVona admitted to one instance of hitting Harding at an ice rink.[9] In January 2018, Harding's childhood friend and filmmaker, Sandra Luckow, spoke in defence of Harding's mother because she felt that the 2017 film I, Tonya stretched some truths about LaVona's character. Luckow said that although Harding's mother could be ""egregious"" towards her daughter, LaVona actually funded and appreciated Harding's skating lessons – and had ""a huge amount of humanity.""[10][11][12]

In Harding's 2008 authorized biography, The Tonya Tapes (written by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews with Harding), she stated she was the victim of acquaintance rape in 1991[13] and that her half-brother, Chris Davison, molested her on several occasions when she was a child. In 1986, Harding called the police after Davison had been sexually harassing and terrorizing her. He was arrested and spent a short time in prison. Harding claimed that her parents were in denial about Davison's behavior and told her not to press criminal charges against him. Davison was killed in a 1988 unsolved vehicular hit-and-run accident.[14][15] On May 3, 1994, during an interview with Rolonda Watts, Harding said that Chris Davison was the lone person in her life unworthy of forgiveness and ""the only person I've ever hated.""[16][17]

Skating career [ edit ]

Harding trained as a figure skater throughout her youth with coach Diane Rawlinson. In the mid-1980s, she began working her way up the competitive skating ladder. She placed sixth at the 1986 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, fifth in 1987 and 1988, and third in 1989. After competing in the February 1989 Nationals Championship, Harding began training with Dody Teachman as her coach.[18][19] She then won the October 1989 Skate America competition, and was considered a strong contender at the February 1990 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. However, she was suffering from the flu and asthma and had a poor free skate. After the original program, she dropped from second place and finished seventh overall. Harding was a powerful free skater and typically had lower placements in the compulsory figures.[21][22]

Harding's breakthrough year came in 1991 when, at the U.S. Championships, she completed her first triple Axel in competition on February 16 — the first American woman to execute the jump.[23] She won the 1991 U.S. Ladies' Singles title with the event's first 6.0 technical merit score since Janet Lynn's 1973 performance at the U.S. Championships.[21] At the March 1991 World Championships, an international event, she again completed the triple Axel. Harding would finish second behind Kristi Yamaguchi, and in front of Nancy Kerrigan, marking the first time one country swept the ladies medal podium at the World Figure Skating Championships.[24]

At the September 1991 Skate America competition, Harding recorded three more firsts:

The first woman to complete a triple Axel in the short program

The first woman to successfully execute two triple Axels in a single competition

The first ever to complete a triple Axel in combination (with the double toe loop)

Despite these record-breaking performances, after 1991, Harding was never again able to successfully complete the triple Axel in competition; her competitive results began to decline. She and Dody Teachman had briefly parted ways in April 1991, but had reunited in June;[15] Harding was still training under Teachman for the upcoming 1992 season.[25] She placed third in the January 1992 U.S. Figure Skating Championships despite twisting her ankle during practice, and finished fourth in the February 1992 Winter Olympics. On March 1, 1992, Harding gave Teachman a summary dismissal and returned to Diane Rawlinson to be coached by her.[18][26] On March 29 Harding placed sixth in the 1992 World Championships, although she had a better placement at the November 1992 Skate Canada International event finishing fourth. In the 1993 season, she skated poorly in the U.S. Championships and failed to qualify for the World Championship team.[28][29]

In January 1994, Harding won the U.S. Championships but was later stripped of her title. The USFSA disciplinary panel voted to vacate the title in June 1994, following an investigation of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. In February 1994, Harding was permitted to remain a member U.S Olympic ice skating team, despite brief legal controversy.[30][31] After an issue with a broken skate lace in the long program, she was given a re-skate by the judges and finished in eighth place, behind Oksana Baiul (gold) and Nancy Kerrigan (silver).[32]

Figure skating record [ edit ]

^† In June 1994, Claire Ferguson, the President of the U.S. Figure Skating Association, voted to strip Harding of her 1994 title. However, the competition results were not changed and the title was left vacant rather than moving all the other competitors up one position.[37]

Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath [ edit ]

On January 6, 1994 ( ), one day before the U.S. Figure Skating Championship first Ladies' Singles competition, Nancy Kerrigan was attacked in a corridor after a practice session at the Detroit Cobo Arena. The immediate aftermath of the attack was recorded on a news camera and broadcast around the world. The assailant was Shane Stant, contracted to break her right leg; he turned himself in to Phoenix FBI on January 14.[38][39][40] Stant and his uncle, Derrick Smith, were hired for this assault by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her one-time bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt.[41] After failing to find Kerrigan in Massachusetts, Stant had taken a 20-hour bus trip to Detroit.[42] Nancy Kerrigan was walking behind a curtain when Stant rushed behind her. Using both hands, he then swung a 21 in (53 cm) ASP telescopic baton at her right leg, striking her above the knee. The intent of the attack was to seriously injure Kerrigan so that she would be unable to compete in both the National Championships (Kerrigan was the defending 1993 Champion) and the Winter Olympics. Kerrigan's leg was not broken but severely bruised, forcing her to withdraw from the Championships and forgo competing to retain the U.S. Ladies' title.[43] On January 8, Harding won the U.S. title; she and Kerrigan were then both selected for the 1994 Olympic team.[44]

On February 1, 1994, Gillooly's attorney negotiated a plea bargain in exchange for testimony regarding all involved parties in the attack. In July, he was sentenced to two years in prison after publicly apologizing to Kerrigan – even though, he said, ""any apology coming from me rings hollow.""[45][46] Gillooly and Eckardt pleaded guilty to racketeering, Stant and Smith (who drove Stant in the getaway car and funneled money) pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree assault.[47][48] Judge Donald Londer noted the attack could have injured Kerrigan more seriously.[49] Eckardt died in 2007.[50] On February 25, Harding finished eighth in the Olympics; Nancy Kerrigan, having recovered from her injury, won the Olympic silver behind gold medalist Oksana Baiul from Ukraine.

Harding's practice sessions at Clackamas Town Center , in preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympics, were attended by thousands of spectators and dozens of reporters and film crews

On January 11, 1994, Ann Schatz interviewed Harding at the KOIN-TV station in Portland, Oregon. Schatz asked if she had considered whether someone she knew had planned to attack Nancy. Harding answered ""I have definitely thought about it. No one controls my life but me...if there’s something in there that I don’t like, I’m going to change it.""[51][52][53] Harding also confirmed she had spoken with FBI agents while in Detroit and again in Portland.[54] On January 13, Eckardt and Smith were arrested.[55][56] On January 14, the USFSA made a statement on whether Eckardt's arrest affected Harding's Olympic placement: ""we will deal only with the facts.""[57][58] Harding and Gillooly's separate lawyers confirmed the couple were in daily contact and cooperation with law enforcement.[59] On January 15, Harding and Gillooly spoke with reporters, but declined to comment about the investigation.[60] On January 16, her lawyer read a news conference statement denying Harding's involvement in the attack on Kerrigan.[61][62] Harding left her home that evening to practice figure skating with her coaches, where she spoke with reporters and performed a triple Axel.[63][64][65]

On January 18, 1994, Harding was with her lawyers when she submitted to questioning by the district attorney and FBI.[66][67] She was interviewed for over 10 hours – 8 hours into the interview, her lawyer issued a statement announcing her separation from Jeff Gillooly: ""I continue to believe that Jeff is innocent of any wrongdoing. I wish him nothing but the best.""[68] Her full FBI transcript was press released on February 1. The Seattle Times reported the transcript stating that Harding had ""changed her story well into a long interview...After hours of denying any involvement in trying to cover up the plot, an FBI agent finally 'told [her] that he knew she had lied to him, that he would tell her exactly how she had lied to him'.""[69][70][71] In the transcript's final passage, Harding stated ""I hope everyone understands. I'm telling on someone I really care about. I know now [Jeff] is involved. I'm sorry.""[1][72] On January 19, Jeff Gillooly surrendered to the FBI.[73] On January 20, Diane Sawyer asked Harding on Primetime Live about the criminal investigation. Harding said she had done nothing wrong.[74] On January 27, it was reported that Gillooly had been testifying about the attack plot since January 26; possibly implicating Harding as having allegedly assisted. Harding's close friend Stephanie Quintero, with whom she was living, spoke to reporters on her behalf: ""[Tonya] was shocked, very hurt…She was believing in [Jeff], what he was saying.""[75][76][77] Harding later held an 11am press conference to read a prepared statement. She said she was sorry Nancy Kerrigan was attacked, that she respected Nancy, and claimed not to know in advance of the plot to disable her. Harding then publicly took responsibility ""for failing to report things [about the assault] when I returned home from Nationals [on January 10]...my failure to immediately report this information is not a crime.""[78][79] Many state laws including Oregon certify that the act of concealing criminal knowledge alone is not a crime.[80]

The attack on Kerrigan received a lot of publicity and news media crews camped outside her home.[81] In January 1994, the story was on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Newsweek, and TIME.[82] There was now much speculation about Harding's alleged involvement in the assault plot.[83][84][85][86][87] Because Harding and Kerrigan would be representing the U.S. in the February Hamar Olympic Games, speculation reached a media frenzy.[88][89] Abby Haight and J.E. Vader, journalists for The Oregonian, wrote a biography of Harding called Fire on Ice, which included excerpts of her January 18 FBI interview.[90] News media began attending Harding's Portland practices, and unwelcomely recorded footage of her on February 7, running barefoot to stop a tow truck from hauling her illegally parked pickup.[91] On February 10, Connie Chung interviewed Harding. When asked about Gillooly, Harding said ""I never did anything to hurt [Jeff]. If I ever did anything, it was to stick up for him and protect him.""[92] Chung also negotiated to fly on the same airplane with Harding to Oslo, leaving on February 15, and interviewed her again in Norway. Chung admitted she would not have travelled to Norway were it not for the scandal.[93][94] The media frenzy continued on February 17, when Nancy Kerrigan and Harding shared the ice at a practice session in the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Approximately 400 members of the press were there to document this practice.[95] Scott Hamilton believed the sport was depicted as a ""tabloid event."" It was noted that Nancy Kerrigan chose to wear the same skating costume at the practice session that she was when Stant attacked her.[97][98] Kerrigan later confirmed that her choice of dress that day was deliberate: ""Humour is good, it's empowering.""[99][100] The tape-delayed broadcast of the February 23 Ladies' Olympic technical program remains one of the most watched telecasts in American history.[101][102]

Figure skating competitions for the 1994 Winter Olympics were held in the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, now known as the CC Amfi

On February 5, 1994, the disciplinary panel of the U.S. Figure Skating Association stated reasonable grounds existed to believe Harding had violated the sport's code of ethics.[103] Her admitted failure to report about an assault on a fellow competitor, supported by her FBI transcripts, resulted in Harding being formally charged with ""[making] false statements about her knowledge."" The panel also recommended that she face a disciplinary hearing. Claire Ferguson, president of the USFSA, decided not to suspend Harding's membership before a hearing took place. If Harding had been suspended, she likely still would have competed at Olympics after filing suit, seeking an injunction against USFSA, and asserting her Amateur Sports Act of 1978 rights.[104] The panel examined evidence including the testimonies of Stant and Smith, Harding and Gillooly's telephone records, and notes found in a Portland saloon trash bin on January 30.[105] Harding was given 30 days to respond.[106] On March 9, Judge Owen Panner granted her a requested halt on the 30-day deadline to delay her disciplinary hearing until June.[107][108][109] Meanwhile, Portland authorities stated the criminal investigation would conclude by March 21 with any indictments and a grand jury report to be made at that time.[110][111]

On March 16, 1994, Harding pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution as a Class C felony offense at a Multnomah County court hearing. She and her lawyer, Robert Weaver, negotiated a plea bargain ensuring no further prosecution.[112] Judge Donald Londer conducted routine questioning to make certain Harding understood her agreement, that she was entering her plea ""knowingly and voluntarily."" Harding told Londer she was. Her plea admissions were knowing of the assault plot after the fact, settling on a cover story with Gillooly and Eckardt on January 10, witnessing pay phone calls to Smith affirming the story on January 10 and 11, and lying to FBI with the story on January 18.[113][114][115] Law enforcement investigators had been following and videotaping the co-conspirators since January 10; they knew about the pay phone calls.[116][45][117] Her penalties included 3 years of probation, $100,000 fine, and 500 hours community service. She agreed to reimburse Multnomah County $10,000 in legal expenses, undergo a psychiatric examination, and volunteered to give $50,000 to the Special Olympics Oregon (SOOR) charity.[111] Oregon sentencing guidelines carried a max penalty of 5-years-prison for the offense.[118]

Phil Knight, CEO of Nike, donated $25,000 toward Harding's legal fees.[119][120] She had also made approximately $600,000 from an Inside Edition deal.[121][122] Harding's plea conditions imposed her U.S. Figure Skating Assn resignation, necessitating her withdrawal from the World Championships (for which she was scheduled to leave on March 17).[123] District attorney Norman Frink stated that if Harding had not agreed to the plea, ""we would have proceeded with an indictment on all possible charges...punishment was taking away [skating] privilege.""[113][124] Weaver said the plea agreement was satisfactory to Harding, partly because she avoided prison. Regarding trial concerns, he stated ""we would have prevailed at trial.""[111][125] An executive of the USFSA commented ""[We] don't know if Tonya is innocent or guilty...if [she was involved before] the national championship.""[126] On March 18, Claire Ferguson decided Harding's disciplinary hearing would still proceed in June. The USFSA's executive committee convened to discuss their position should Harding seek reinstatement and whether they might strip her of the 1994 National Championship title. Neither issue was decided at that time.[127]

On March 21, 1994, a Portland grand jury issued an indictment stating there was evidence Harding participated in the attack plot. The indictment concluded more than two months of investigation and witness testimonies from Diane Rawlinson, Erika Bakacs (Harding's choreographer), Eckardt's college instructor and classmates, and Vera Marano (a freelance figure skating writer in Philadelphia).[128][113][129][45] It stated there was evidence Harding fraudulently used USFSA provided skating monies to finance the assault. It also read that Harding, Gillooly, Eckardt, Smith, and Stant agreed to ""knowingly cause physical injury...by means of a dangerous weapon."" The grand jury foreman said the evidence inferred Harding as ""involved from the beginning or very close."" She was not charged in the indictment due to the terms of her March 16 plea agreement.[108][130] On June 29, the USFSA disciplinary panel met for nine hours over two days to consider Harding's alleged role in the attack.[131] On June 30, chairman William Hybl stated ""By a preponderance of the evidence, the panel did conclude that she had prior knowledge and was involved prior to the incident. This is based on civil standards, not criminal standards...bank records, phone records – the way they came together to establish a case."" The panel decided that pertinent FBI reports, court documents, and Harding's March 16 plea agreement presented ""a clear disregard for fairness, good sportsmanship, and ethical behaviour.""[107] Harding chose neither to attend nor participate in the two-day hearing. Robert Weaver said the decision disappointed her but was not a surprise, and that she had not decided on an appeal.[37][132] Harding was stripped of the 1994 U.S. Championship title and banned for life from participating in USFSA events as either skater or coach. The USFSA has no dominion over professional skating events, yet Harding was also persona non grata on the pro circuit, few skaters and promoters would work with her. She did not benefit from the ensuing boom in professional skating after the scandal.

Shortly before the 1998 Winter Olympics, the CBS and Fox news divisions re-examined the scandal for two televised special reports.[134][135] Harry Smith hosted the CBS special. He reported that Harding still held to her statement from her press conference given on January 27, 1994: ""I had no prior knowledge of the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan."" Smith then interviewed Kerrigan, asking how she responded to that statement. Nancy Kerrigan referred to transcripts she had read from Harding's FBI interview on January 18, 1994. After reading through the interrogation of that day, she concluded that ""[Tonya] knew more than she admits.""[136][129][137] The Fox special report was called Breaking the Ice: The Women of '94 Revisited, hosted by James Brown with interviews from Harding, Gillooly, and Kerrigan.[138] Jeff Gillooly (granted a name change to Jeff Stone in 1995) said Harding's prison evasion did not anger him, and that he felt his own punishment was just. Stone reflected on Harding's position of ""limited involvement"" in Kerrigan's attack and speculated that a ""guilty conscience"" still troubled her. Brown then mediated a joint interview with both Kerrigan and Harding present. The two former competitors shared sincere desires for happy families and general well-wishes toward one other. Nancy Kerrigan said she hoped Harding could learn from past mistakes and ""find happiness.""[139] Harding said she was grateful to personally express remorse to Kerrigan again.[140]

In Harding's 2008 biography, The Tonya Tapes (transcribed by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews), she stated that she wanted to call the FBI in 1994 to reveal what she knew, but decided not to when Gillooly allegedly threatened her with death following a gunpoint gang rape by him and two other men she did not know. Jeff (Gillooly) Stone responded with surprise that groundless claims against him could be published and specifically contended her gang rape accusation to be ""utterly ridiculous.""[141] In 2013, Deadspin sought Jeff Stone for an interview and he again defended himself from the gunpoint gang rape allegation. Yet he expressed regret that Harding is often ""remembered for what I talked her into doing,"" meaning allegedly plotting to injure Nancy Kerrigan.[142][137][84][38][1][143] Stone admitted that his past stupidity was part of Harding's 1994 ruin and maintained that he still considered her a great figure skater. He also said ""I've had it easy, compared to poor Tonya...she tends to be the butt of the joke. It's kind of sad to me.""[144]

In 2014, Nancy Kerrigan addressed the scandal during a brief interview with sportscaster Bob Costas: ""Whatever apology Tonya has given, I accept it. It's time for all us – I've always wished [Tonya] well – she has her own family, I have my family. It's time to make that our focus and move on with our lives.""[145]

Later celebrity [ edit ]

On February 15, 1994, an explicit 1991 videotape clip of Harding topless was shown on A Current Affair; three still frames from this clip were also published in The Sun (a British tabloid newspaper).[146][147] The New York Post reported that Jeff Gillooly had supplied the videotaped fragment for an undisclosed sum of money.[148] On July 26, 1994, Penthouse magazine announced that its September issue would feature different stills of Harding and Gillooly having sex from the same extended videotape.[149] This 35-minute sex tape would also be copied and marketed exclusively by Penthouse.[150] Both Gillooly and Harding used the same agent to negotiate equal payment on the Penthouse sale.[151]

Harding in 2006

On June 22, 1994, in Portland, Oregon, Harding appeared on an AAA professional wrestling show as the manager for wrestling stable Los Gringos Locos. The night's performance included Art Barr and Eddie Guerrero. A promotional musical event was unsuccessful when Harding and her band, the Golden Blades, were booed off the stage at their only performance, in 1995 in Portland, Oregon.[153][154]

In 1994, Harding was cast in a low-budget action film, Breakaway. The film was released in 1996.[155] On October 29, 1996, Harding received media attention after using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to help revive an 81-year-old woman, Alice Olson, who collapsed at a bar in Portland while playing video poker.[156]

Harding has also appeared on television, on the game show The Weakest Link: ""15 Minutes of Fame Edition"" in 2002 along with Kato Kaelin,[157] and in March 2008 became a commentator for TruTV's The Smoking Gun Presents: World's Dumbest....[158]

Boxing career [ edit ]

In 2002, Harding boxed against Paula Jones on the Fox TV network Celebrity Boxing event, winning the fight. On February 22, 2003, she made her official women's professional boxing debut, losing a four-round split decision against Samantha Browning on the undercard of Mike Tyson vs. Clifford Etienne. Harding's boxing career came about amid rumors that she was having financial difficulties and needed to fight in the ring to earn money.[159] She did another celebrity boxing match, on The Man Show, and won against co-host Doug Stanhope. Stanhope later claimed on his podcast that the fight was fixed because Tonya Harding refused to ""fight a man.""[160]

On March 23, 2004, it was reported that she canceled a planned boxing match against Tracy Carlton in Oakland, California, because of an alleged death threat against her.[161]

On June 24, 2004, after reportedly not having boxed for over a year, she was beaten in a match in Edmonton, Alberta, by Amy Johnson. Fans reportedly booed her as she entered the ring and cheered wildly for Johnson when she won in the third round.[162]

Her boxing career was cut short by a physical condition she attributed to asthma.[163] Her overall record was 3 wins and 3 losses.

Professional boxing record [ edit ]

Professional record summary 6 fights 3 wins 3 losses By knockout 0 2 By decision 3 1

Automobile racing land speed record [ edit ]

On August 12, 2009, Harding set a new land speed record for a vintage gas coupe with a speed of 97.177 mph (156.391 km/h; 43.442 m/s) driving a 1931 Ford Model A, named Lickity-Split, on the Bonneville Salt Flats.[164][165][166] Her setting of that land speed record was featured on an episode[which?] of TruTV Presents: World's Dumbest... that focused on ""Record Breakers.""

Dancing with the Stars [ edit ]

In April 2018, Harding was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 26 of Dancing with the Stars. She was partnered with professional dancer Sasha Farber. The couple reached the finals of the competition, where Harding finished in third place overall, behind Adam Rippon and Josh Norman.

Personal life [ edit ]

In September 1986, when she was 15 years old, Harding began a relationship with 17-year-old Jeff Gillooly. They moved into a starter home together in 1988 when he worked in distribution at the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. They married on March 18, 1990, when she was 19 and he was 22. In January 1992, Harding told Terry Richard (a journalist for The Oregonian) ""Jeff always put food on the table and a roof over my head. He paid for my skating for a couple of years. If it hadn't been for him during that time, I wouldn't have been skating.""[169] On August 28, 1993, they divorced after a tumultuous marriage.[1][170][171] During the autumn of 1993, it was reported that Gillooly was working part-time managing Harding's career and taking real-estate classes.[172][173] Harding and Gillooly had been continuing to see each other since early October 1993 and were sharing a rented chalet[174] together in Beavercreek, Oregon until the evening of January 18, 1994.[73]

She married her second husband, Michael Smith, in 1995; they divorced in 1996.[175] She married and took the surname of 42-year-old Joseph Price, whom she met at a local restaurant called Timbers, on June 23, 2010 when she was 39 years old. She gave birth to her only child, a son named Gordon, on February 19, 2011.[176]

Since leaving skating and boxing, Harding has worked as a welder, a painter at a metal fabrication company, and a hardware sales clerk at Sears.[177] As of 2017, she stated that she worked as a painter and deck builder.[178] She resides in Washington state.[179]

On an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on February 26, 2018, Harding stated that she is still active in skating and practices three times a week. In a segment during the show, she performed several jumps and spins. She trains with her former coach, Dody Teachman.[180]

Cultural significance [ edit ]

Harding's life, career, and role in the Kerrigan attack have been widely referenced in popular culture; appearing in television, film, music, as well as a primary campaign speech by former President Barack Obama.[181] In 2014, Matt Harkins and Viviana Olen created the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding Museum in their Brooklyn, New York, apartment, dedicated to collecting and archiving memorabilia related to Harding and the incident.[182] Harkins and Olen stated in a 2017 interview that they had been captivated by Harding's life for years, citing it as ""the most American story ever told.""[183] A contemporaneous article published in Vogue also noted that Harding had developed a ""cult following"" in the years since her notoriety.[184]

Representation in other media [ edit ]

Academic assessment [ edit ]

Because Harding admitted to obstructing the investigation of Nancy Kerrigan's assault, her name is often first associated with the 1994 scandal. However, numerous academic essays have theorized additional reasons, particularly considering her national class culture and past figure skating membership, for Harding's perceived social stigmatization.[212]

In 1995, the book Women on Ice: Feminist Essays on the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan Spectacle was published, containing numerous essays analyzing Harding's public image. For example, Abigail Feder wrote that there existed ""overdetermined femininity in Ladies' Figure Skating...femininity and athleticism are mutually exclusive concepts in American culture.""[214] Sam Stoloff believed that, during the scandal, the media placed a greater emphasis on Harding's class rather than her gender (femininity). He noted how she was subjected to a ""litany of vaguely pejorative or mocking expressions"" associated with ""low class"" cultural attributes, sometimes due to Harding's personal interests and hobbies. Stoloff theorized that Harding represented an American social class that required interpretation (""the class Other"") as he referenced the anthropological tone of Susan Orlean's 1994 essay ""Figures in a Mall,"" written for The New Yorker.[215][174]

In academic Sarah Marshall's 2014 essay entitled ""Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power and Pain,"" she noted the pervasive role of the media in the 1994 scandal, particularly the manner in which Harding's life outside the realm of skating became publicly scrutinized: ""Somehow, in the scandal's aftermath, the form of the Tonya-bash was able to alchemize even the most chilling details of Tonya's life into tabloid gold."" Marshall also examined the role of Harding's ""tomboy"" persona in the context of figure skating. She theorized that Harding was rejected by the figure skating ethos because she did not conform – as Marshall believed many figure skaters including Nancy Kerrigan did – to appearing as ""beautiful without being sexual, strong without being intimidating, and vulnerable without being weak.""[212]

In Tyler Chase Knowles' 2016 honors thesis entitled ""Taking Out the Trash: Middle Class Anxieties and The White Trash Menace,"" he extrapolated on a quotation made by Emma Gray in her 2014 HuffPost article. The quotation explored how Gray believed Harding was labelled ""the skating world's perfect villain"" due to her appearance, broken home, and impoverished background.[216] Knowles theorized that there also existed the socio-cultural personified ""Defender"" who also chose to reject Harding. He defined the ""Defender"" as a person or persons who sympathize(s) with the working poor, a group including the white underclass. The ""Defender"" would blame the plight of the poor on societal and economic factors, yet the ""Defender"" would continue to reinforce conventional values such as distinguishing the class border. Knowles argued that Harding did not belong in the ""Defender's"" approved category of ""poor white"" because she did not – in the opinion of the ""Defender"" – make enough effort, given her figure skating membership, to assimilate towards elite culture. The ""Defender"" wanted Tonya Harding to use her USFSA membership for social mobility, caring little whether she could prove herself to be among the best Olympic competitors.[217]

Super Bowl XLI was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2006 season. The Colts defeated the Bears by the score of 29–17. The game was played on February 4, 2007 at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.

This game featured two teams ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts. The Colts, who finished with a 12–4 regular season record, were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team's tenure in Baltimore, they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Meanwhile, the Bears, who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record, were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. In addition, the Bears' Lovie Smith and the Colts' Tony Dungy both became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl, with Dungy the first to win.

In the first Super Bowl played in rainy conditions, the Colts overcame a 14–6 first-quarter deficit to outscore the Bears 23–3 in the last three quarters. Chicago posted the then-earliest lead in Super Bowl history when returner Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown after 14 seconds had elapsed (a record later broken in Super Bowl XLVIII when the Seattle Seahawks scored a safety 12 seconds into the game). The Colts forced five turnovers, including cornerback Kelvin Hayden's 56-yard interception return for a touchdown. Indianapolis kicker Adam Vinatieri also scored three field goals. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, with one interception for a passer rating of 81.8.

CBS' broadcast of the game was watched by an estimated average of 93.2 million viewers, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history.[10] The halftime show, headlined by the musician Prince, peaked at 140 million television viewers, and was widely acclaimed by music critics.[11]

Background [ edit ]

Host selection process [ edit ]

Dolphin Stadium won the bid to host Super Bowl XLI on September 17, 2003 after a campaign against Phoenix, Tampa, New York City, and Washington, D.C.. With this game, the Miami Metropolitan Area tied New Orleans, Louisiana as the city to host the most Super Bowls (9).[12]

This was the fourth Super Bowl at Dolphin Stadium, which has also been known as ""Joe Robbie Stadium"" and ""Pro Player Stadium"". The venue previously hosted Super Bowls XXIII (broadcast on NBC), XXIX (on ABC), and XXXIII (on FOX). Super Bowls II, III, V, X, and XIII were also in Miami, but held at the Miami Orange Bowl. This was the first Super Bowl played at the stadium since the city of Miami Gardens where the stadium is located was incorporated on May 13, 2003.

In February 2006, the NFL and the South Florida Super Bowl XLI Host Committee unveiled the slogan ""one game, one dream"" for the game, referring to the entire South Florida region working together to present the event.[13] The Super Bowl XLI logo was also unveiled, featuring the colors orange (to represent the sun) and blue (for the ocean).[13] The ""I"" in the Roman numeral ""XLI"" was drawn to resemble a pylon placed at each corner of an end zone because ""the goal is to get to the game.""[13] The logo had the same shade of orange as the logo of the host city's home team, the Miami Dolphins. The ""XL"" part was similar to that of Super Bowl XL's logo.

Teams [ edit ]

Indianapolis Colts [ edit ]

The Colts' first trip to the Super Bowl in 36 years set a record for longest time between appearances by a team. Their return was the culmination of a nine-year-long building process. In 1998, they drafted quarterback Peyton Manning to lead the team. Over the next four seasons, Manning, along with other stars such as receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James, turned the Colts into one of the best offensive teams in the NFL, but the team struggled to find consistency on defense and always ended up with either a losing season or elimination from the playoffs in the first round. In 2002, Indianapolis fired head coach Jim Mora and replaced him with Tony Dungy. Dungy had developed one of the best defenses in the NFL while coaching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it was hoped he could solve the Colts' defensive problems as well.

Over the next four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41–0 in the wild card round by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind impressive offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts had one of the most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.

In 2005, the Colts' defense improved, making the team the clear favorites in the NFL. They won the first 13 games of the season and finished with a 14–2 record, while ranking second in the NFL in both points scored and fewest points allowed. But once again they lost in the divisional round of the playoffs, this time to the #6 seeded Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–18. After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost some key players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker Mike Vanderjagt, the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left for the Dallas Cowboys.

Still, the Colts remained one of the AFC's top teams in the 2006 season. Manning made the Pro Bowl for the 7th time in his career, completing 362 of 555 passes for 4,397 yards and an NFL-best 31 touchdowns, with an additional 4 rushing touchdowns and with only 9 interceptions and 15 sacks. His favorite target was Harrison, who caught 95 passes for 1,366 yards and 12 touchdowns. Receiver Reggie Wayne was also a major deep threat with 86 receptions for 1,310 yards and 9 touchdowns. Tight ends Ben Utecht and Dallas Clark were also reliable targets, each recording over 30 receptions for over 300 yards. On the ground, rookie running back Joseph Addai led the team with 1,081 yards and a 4.8 yards-per-carry average despite not starting any games in the regular season. He also caught 40 receptions for 325 yards and scored 8 touchdowns. Running back Dominic Rhodes was also a major contributor, rushing for 641 yards and catching 36 passes for 251 yards. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers Jeff Saturday and Tarik Glenn. On special teams, the Colts signed kicker Adam Vinatieri to replace Vanderjagt. While Vinatieri's career field goal percentage was lower, the Colts considered him to be an improvement because of his reputation for making ""clutch"" kicks, a reputation aided by his game winning field goals in Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII.

Indianapolis' defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis (who recorded 9.5 sacks and forced 4 fumbles) were widely considered to be among the best pass-rushing defensive ends in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker Cato June led the team in tackles (92) and interceptions (3). The Colts' run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return yardage allowed and 31st in average punt return yardage allowed.

Indianapolis started out the season winning their first nine games, but ended up losing four of their next seven and finished with a 12–4 record, giving them the #3 playoff seed. Therefore, they had to play in a wild card playoff game. In the playoffs, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23-8, defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15-6 in the divisional round, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI with a 38-34 win over the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game.

Chicago Bears [ edit ]

Chicago finished the season with an NFC best 13–3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 27-24 in the divisional round of the playoffs, and the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the NFC Championship game to advance to Super Bowl XLI. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive.[14] They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive[14] thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.

The Bears offense was led by quarterback Rex Grossman, the team's first round draft pick in 2003. Over the previous three seasons, Grossman had played in just 8 regular season games due to injuries, but he recovered to start in all 16 games in 2006. By the end of the season, he finished with 3,193 yards and 23 touchdowns, the most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Grossman had difficulty avoiding turnovers, however, and threw 20 interceptions and lost five fumbles during the year. In the last seven games of the season, he turned the ball over 18 times. Many fans and sports writers expected head coach Lovie Smith to bench him at some point, but Smith insisted that Grossman would be the starter throughout the entire season.

Receivers Muhsin Muhammad (60 receptions, 863 yards, 5 touchdowns) and Bernard Berrian (51 receptions, 775 yards, 7 touchdowns) provided the main deep threat on the team, along with tight end Desmond Clark, who caught 45 passes for 626 yards and 6 touchdowns. Chicago's running game was led by running backs Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson. Jones rushed for 1,210 yards and caught 36 passes, while Benson rushed for 647 yards and scored 6 touchdowns.

Chicago's defense allowed the 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100 yards per game on the ground,[15] and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team.[14] The line was anchored by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, two of the three Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. The defense was also able to make up for the offense's poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.

The loss of Harris to injury after the twelfth game of the season coincided with a decline in defensive performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9).[16] After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship game were held below 21 points.[17]

The Bears' special teams sent three players to the Pro Bowl, including special teams ace Brendon Ayanbadejo, kicker Robbie Gould (who led all NFL kickers with 143 points), and rookie return man Devin Hester, who gained 600 punt return yards with a 12.8 yards per return average, the second highest in the NFL. He also set a league record with 6 touchdowns on special teams.

Playoffs [ edit ]

Although the Colts' rushing defense looked extremely weak during the season, it ended up being a key factor on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Indianapolis defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23–8, holding Chiefs running back Larry Johnson (who rushed for 1,789 yards during the season) to just 32 yards on 13 carries. Then, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15–6, winning on a playoff record-tying five field goals by Vinatieri and holding running back Jamal Lewis (who rushed for 1,132 yards during the season) to just 53 yards.

Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England jumped to an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed back in the second half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an additional field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69 yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.

Meanwhile, the Bears started out their post-season with a 27–24 win over the Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they defeated the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the NFC Championship Game. Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since 1985. Thomas Jones finished the game with a franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.

It was the first time since the 1996 postseason that the home team won both of the conference championship games. The Colts were the first dome team to win the Super Bowl in an outdoor game (the St. Louis Rams were the first dome team to win a Super Bowl, XXXIV inside the Georgia Dome in Atlanta). The 2006 Indianapolis Colts were the first division champion to win a Super Bowl with four postseason wins and the second division champion (2003 Carolina Panthers) to win a conference title with three postseason wins.

For the Bears, this marked the first time that a Chicago sports team not owned by Jerry Reinsdorf had reached the champion game/series in their league since the Blackhawks lost in the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.

Super Bowl pre-game practices and notes [ edit ]

Dolphin Stadium prepares for Super Bowl XLI

The Indianapolis Colts held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Dolphins Training Facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida. The Colts' ""Team and Family"" hotel was the Marriott Harbor Beach.[19] At the 2007 Indianapolis 500 pre-race ceremonies on May 27, 2007, eventual Super Bowl XLI MVP Peyton Manning stated to ABC Sports commentator Brent Musburger the day before the game that two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Hélio Castroneves gave a pep talk to the Colts team.

The Chicago Bears held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Hurricanes Football Facility, on the campus of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson was required to request a judge's order to leave the state of Illinois due to an arrest for unlicensed ownership of six firearms and two assault rifles. On January 23, 2007, the judge granted him permission to travel out of state to play in the Super Bowl.[20]

Chicago and Indianapolis are the two closest cities, geographically, to ever play in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293 km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are slightly closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, at the end of the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.[21]

This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl VI that all players on both teams wore black shoes.

Broadcasting [ edit ]

United States [ edit ]

The game was televised in the United States by CBS in high-definition with play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz and color commentator Phil Simms. This was the first Super Bowl announced by Nantz.[22] Additionally, the game had Steve Tasker (Bears sideline) and Solomon Wilcots (Colts sideline) reporting on the sidelines and Lesley Visser (Bears sideline) and Sam Ryan (Colts sideline) in the stands.

This was the first Super Bowl aired on CBS since the Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake incident three years earlier, in Super Bowl XXXVIII; and the first since the Viacom/CBS split at the end of 2005. Extensive pre-game coverage, hosted by The NFL Today team of James Brown, Shannon Sharpe, Boomer Esiason and Dan Marino, whose name graces the address of the game site (2269 Dan Marino Boulevard), began at noon (US EST) with NFL Films' ""Road to the Super Bowl"" year in review (narrated by Tom Selleck). This was followed by ""The Phil Simms All-Iron Team"", and a four-and-a-half-hour Super Bowl Today pre-game show followed by game coverage at 6:25 PM.[23] Other contributors to the pre-game show included Katie Couric, anchor of the CBS Evening News, Armen Keteyian, CBS News Chief Investigative Corrrespondent, Randy Cross, who reported from Iraq where U.S. military forces played a touch football game known as ""The Baghdad Bowl"" and Dick Enberg, who participated in his 12th Super Bowl telecast as a host, play-by-play announcer, or contributor. Westwood One provided radio coverage of the event, with Marv Albert and Boomer Esiason as announcers.[24]

""The Baghdad Bowl"" flag football game played in Iraq.

The American Forces Network (AFN) provided coverage of the Super Bowl for U.S. forces stationed overseas and to all U.S. Navy ships at sea.[25]

The opening title sequence of CBS television coverage featured the composition Lux Aeterna, by artist Clint Mansell, in the background.

Nielsen Media Research reported 93 million viewers for Super Bowl XLI, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history (trailing only the M*A*S*H finale and Super Bowls XLIII, XXX, and XLII).[10]

Commercials [ edit ]

Advertising rates were reported as being slightly higher than in the year before, with CBS confirming a price of $2.6 million for some 30-second spots, compared with $2.5 million during Super Bowl XL. However, CNN reported that after discounts, the average price is likely closer to $1.8 to $2 million. Familiar advertisers in recent years such as Anheuser-Busch, CareerBuilder, General Motors and Coca-Cola bought multiple advertising spots, and other popular advertisers like Go Daddy and Emerald Nuts had commercials this year.[9]

The only major hype related to commercials in the months leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.[26]

The annual USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter survey chose a Budweiser ad featuring crabs worshiping an ice chest with that particular beer inside as the top ad of Super Bowl XLI, followed by another Bud commercial featuring a stray dog with mud spots climbing onto the brewery's trademark Clydsedale-drawn wagon in a parade. In all, Anheuser-Busch took seven of the top ten spots in the annual survey, sweeping the top three spots. A YouTube user survey chose the Doritos ""Snack Hard"" ad (produced for the incredible price of $12, the cost of three bags of the snack product)[27] as their top ad, that ad finished fourth in the USA Today survey. ADBOWL results were slightly different with only 6 of Anheuser-Busch's ads finishing in the top ten. The highest ranked being the Bud Light ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" spot. Also in the top ten were Blockbuster Video's ""Mouse"", Doritos' ""Car Wreck"", GM's ""Robot"" and Taco Bell's ""Lion's Talk 'Carne'.""

One ad that drew criticism from the gay community was for the Snickers candy bar featuring two men accidentally ""kissing"" each other after sharing the product in question, then proceeded to rip chest hairs as a manly act as homophobic.[28] The ad proved to be controversial, and the ad was cancelled the next day by Masterfoods USA (Mars, Incorporated's snack food division), and three other versions were deleted from the snickers.com web site. The ad was ninth in the USA Today ad survey, and according to a Masterfoods publicist, not intended to harm anyone.

A different ad for General Motors featured a laid off assembly line robot contemplating suicide, which drew criticism from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad be taken off the air and the company's website.[29] The suicide scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25.

International [ edit ]

The Super Bowl was broadcast live in Canada on CBS (which is available in Canada) as well as Global TV and NTV which both took the main CBS commentary, and on the French cable channel RDS. In the United Kingdom the Super Bowl was broadcast on ITV1, Sky Sports 1 & Sky Sports HD1 with Sky Sports taking the main CBS commentary and ITV taking the NFL supplied international commentary feed of Spero Dedes and Sterling Sharpe.

Super Bowl XLI was broadcast in over 200 countries. Amongst the television networks who broadcast Super Bowl XLI were:

Entertainment [ edit ]

Pre-game ceremonies [ edit ]

Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega performed as the pre-game act,[32] and Billy Joel sang the National Anthem, accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was played at the same venue. Joel became the second person to sing the National Anthem twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the national anthem before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last time until Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male artist had sung the national anthem at a Super Bowl.[33]

Marlee Matlin and Jason Hay-Southwell performed the National Anthem in American Sign Language.[34]

Besides participating in the CBS telecast of the pre-game show, Dan Marino also participated in the coin toss along with Norma Hunt, the widow of Lamar Hunt, the former owner of the Kansas City Chiefs and the man who gave the Super Bowl its name.

Halftime show [ edit ]

American singer and musician Prince headlined the halftime show

American singer and musician Prince performed in the halftime show.[35] The setlist for Prince's performance was a short rendition of ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen; Prince's hit songs ""Let's Go Crazy"" and ""Baby I'm a Star""; covers of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Proud Mary"", Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"", and Foo Fighters' ""Best of You""; and finally his signature song ""Purple Rain"" in the downpour. The 12-minute performance featured Prince accompanied by two dancers he called ""The Twinz"" (Maya and Nandy McClean)[36] and the Florida A&M University marching band, the Marching 100.[37] Prince had rehearsed with the drum line for a week before the performance. The performance was on a large, central stage which was shaped like Prince's logo, and was outlined with lights. He played before 74,512 fans at Dolphin Stadium, who had been given flashlights to point at the stage during the performance of ""Purple Rain"". The event was carried ""to the biggest audience of his life"" with 140 million television viewers.[11] Overall, the show was energetic and well received by the rain-soaked audience surrounding the stage.[38] Music critics were extremely enthusiastic about his performance, one calling it ""arguably the best halftime show in Super Bowl history"",[11] and others saying it was one of the best ever.[39][40]

Following the game, controversy emerged about a silhouetted camera shot of Prince, projected against a large sheet by a bright light on the other side of him. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it ""looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed"". Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that ""a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus"".[41] In 2015, Entertainment Tonight listed the silhouetted camera shot, naming it ""Prince's Demon Phallus"", as one of the top seven Super Bowl halftime moments.[42] In 2016, shortly after Prince's death, the halftime show's producer Don Mischer said that having a silhouetted camera shot of Prince was his idea, but denied it was meant to be a phallic statement.[43]

Post-game ceremonies [ edit ]

Former Colts and Dolphins head coach Don Shula presented the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Colts after the game, and Peyton Manning was named MVP.[44]

Game summary [ edit ]

First Quarter [ edit ]

The Bears won the coin toss and elected to receive. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game was played in the rain, which was continuous throughout the game.

The rain did not hinder Bears' return man Devin Hester, who ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown to give Chicago the then earliest lead in Super Bowl history, after only 14 seconds.[45] The Colts avoided kicking to Hester for the rest of the game, allowing him only one punt return, and choosing to squib kick whenever Hester was in the deep kickoff return position. Devin Hester returned the opening kickoff making it one of the fastest touchdowns in NFL history.[46]

On Indianapolis' first drive of the game, defensive back Chris Harris intercepted a deep, third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning and returned it 6 yards to the Bears' 35-yard line. However, Chicago could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and they were forced to punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears' lead to 7–6. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7–6, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt. On the ensuing kickoff, Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff while being tackled by Robert Mathis; Colts linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball. However, on the next play, Indianapolis gave the ball back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the handoff and Bears defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.

On the first play after the turnover, Thomas Jones's 52-yard run moved the ball to the Colts' 5-yard line. Three plays later, Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving the Bears a 14–6 lead. After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.

Second Quarter [ edit ]

Following a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinatieri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14–9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive, and return man Terrence Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to his own 42-yard line. Manning started out the drive with a 22-yard completion to Marvin Harrison. His next pass went to tight end Dallas Clark for 17 yards. Two more completions moved the ball to the Bears' 11-yard line, and then Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16–14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter.

After another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears' 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16–14 at halftime.

Third Quarter [ edit ]

Wilkins returned the second half kickoff 26 yards to the Colts's 38-yard line. On the ensuing possession, Addai rushed five times for 25 yards and caught four passes for 19 yards as the Colts drove 56 yards in 13 plays and scored with a 29-yard field goal from Vinatieri, increasing their lead to 19–14. On the Bears' next drive, Jones started out with a 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up second down and one on the Colts' 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by Anthony McFarland. Then, on third down, he fumbled the snap. Grossman recovered the fumble himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to the Colts' 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52 yards on four carries, with a facemask penalty adding another 10. Chicago managed to halt the drive at their own 2-yard line, but Vinatieri kicked his third field goal to make the score 22–14.

Chicago tight end John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff and returned it 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15 yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was enough for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.

Fourth Quarter [ edit ]

After an Indianapolis 7-play drive ended in a punt, Chicago started on their own 20-yard line with 13:38 left in the game. But four plays later, Colts defensive back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown.

From that point on, the Colts took over the game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts defensive back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 yards to the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.

Box score [ edit ]

Statistical overview [ edit ]

This was the third Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as Dominic Rhodes had 113 for the Colts and Thomas Jones had 112 for the Bears. Tony Dungy is the third man to win the Super Bowl as a head coach as well as a player, following Tom Flores and Mike Ditka.

For the Colts, Rhodes rushed for 113 yards and a touchdown, while also catching an 8-yard reception. Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards. Wilkins returned four kickoffs for 89 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards. Adam Vinatieri became the first kicker ever to play in five Super Bowls and the first to win four Super Bowl rings. Vinatieri's three field goals and two extra points gave him 49 points for the entire 2006 post-season, an NFL record. The Colts' win was the first major professional championship for Indiana since the Indiana Pacers' ABA title in the 1972–73 season.

Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII). Hester's return also kept a streak alive for there being a kickoff return for a touchdown in each Super Bowl played at Dolphin Stadium. Hester's and Wayne's touchdowns in the first quarter marked the first time in Super Bowl history the first two touchdowns were scored by players from the same college (University of Miami). Jones was the Bears' top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching four passes for 18 yards. Desmond Clark was the Bears' top receiver with six receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, leaving him with a QB rating of 68.3 for the game.[49] Muhsin Muhammad became the third player ever to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl for two teams, joining Ricky Proehl and Jerry Rice.

Controversies prohibiting fan parties and presentations [ edit ]

Prohibiting tailgating [ edit ]

The NFL upset many fans by banning the traditional practice of tailgating at Super Bowl XLI. Originally, spokesmen for Dolphin Stadium announced that tailgating would be permitted as usual. However, the NFL quickly contradicted this statement, announcing an NFL owner-imposed ban on all tailgating and prohibiting non-ticketed fans within a two-block-radius of the stadium.[51]

Prohibiting church display [ edit ]

The NFL upset a large number of fans by threatening churches with lawsuits if they had Super Bowl parties. National Football League assistant counsel Rachel L. Margolies sent a letter to the Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis, ordering the church to cancel its party and remove the trademarked Super Bowl name from its website.[52] She said that the church could not use the words ""Super Bowl"" as it violates trademark law, could not charge admission as that violates copyright law, could not use its projection screen (only one television could be used and it could not be over 55 inches), and could not ""promote a message"" in connection with the game. Regarding the last point, the Fall Creek Baptist church planned to also show an extra video to highlight the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith. ""While this may be a noble message"", Rachel L. Margolies wrote, ""we are consistent in refusing the use of our game broadcasts in connection with events that promote a message, no matter the content.""[53] Sports bars nationwide were allowed to show the game, as were businesses that televised sports as part of their everyday operations because they didn't charge admission and they left the message the NFL intended intact.

The Indianapolis Star picked up the story, and soon pastors across the U.S. were working to cancel their parties. Immediately the NFL received a backlash of bad publicity, with indignant football fans in constant sarcasm (akin to rules imposed about on-field behavior i.e. taunting opposition teams) referring to the NFL as the ""No Fun League.""[54] For example, the enforcement of this policy earned the NFL a ""Worst Person in the World"" silver on the edition of February 2, 2007 of Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[55]

After a long series of bad press, the NFL issued a written statement clarifying their policy, saying that they did not object to churches hosting Super Bowl parties so long as they did not charge admission and showed the game on ""a television of the type commonly used at home"". This statement did not attempt to forbid coordination of any other message with the game, something typically done by churches, nor did it attempt to forbid the use of the term ""Super Bowl.""[56][57]",1
462,"REVEALED: Prince Harry ‘does not normally eat this food' – but makes exception in Chicago During a visit to the Hyde Park Academy in the city, several teenage girls were drawn to Prince Harry with one asking him to eat Chicago’s famous style of pizza. She said: “When Prince Harry’s here, he eats Chicago — make sure he has a pizza.” To which the royal revealed his shocking dietary revelation. He replied: “I had pizza last night. I don’t even eat pizza anymore, but I had pizza last night.

GETTY Prince Harry has revealed another secret about his dietary habits on a visit to Chicago

“We had deep dish, and we had thin crust. “I promise you, I will make sure I eat Chicago.” As well as discussing his dietary details with the people of Chicago, the prince also stated his belief that young people hold ""the solutions to some of the world's biggest problems"" at the inaugural Obama Foundation Summit. The Prince, who attended the event a year on from when news of his relationship with actress Meghan Markle hit the headlines, said the younger generation had ""turned me into an optimist"", as he talked about meeting young people across the world.

He said they gave him ""all of my passion and inspiration"", adding: ""The younger generation are the best connected, the most passionate I think we've ever had. ""So what we need to do is we need to create a platform so they can be heard, because they have the solutions to the some of the world's biggest problems."" The 33-year-old spoke openly about how his late mother had inspired him to use his role to help others, and talked of the work of the Royal Foundation, which he set up alongside his brother Prince William in 2009. Earlier in the day, Prince Harry and Michelle Obama had surprised pupils at Hyde Park Academy high school, in the south of Chicago where he was questioned about the city’s unique pizza.

463,"TIME Person of the Year 2017: The Silence Breakers Movie stars are supposedly nothing like you and me. They're svelte, glamorous, self-­possessed. They wear dresses we can't afford and live in houses we can only dream of. Yet it turns out that—in the most painful and personal ways—movie stars are more like you and me than we ever knew.

In 1997, just before Ashley Judd's career took off, she was invited to a meeting with Harvey Weinstein, head of the starmaking studio Miramax, at a Beverly Hills hotel. Astounded and offended by Weinstein's attempt to coerce her into bed, Judd managed to escape. But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence, she began spreading the word.

""I started talking about Harvey the minute that it happened,"" Judd says in an interview with TIME. ""Literally, I exited that hotel room at the Peninsula Hotel in 1997 and came straight downstairs to the lobby, where my dad was waiting for me, because he happened to be in Los Angeles from Kentucky, visiting me on the set. And he could tell by my face—to use his words—that something devastating had happened to me. I told him. I told everyone.""

TIME

She recalls one screenwriter friend telling her that Weinstein's behavior was an open secret passed around on the whisper network that had been furrowing through Hollywood for years. It allowed for people to warn others to some degree, but there was no route to stop the abuse. ""Were we supposed to call some fantasy attorney general of moviedom?"" Judd asks. ""There wasn't a place for us to report these experiences.""

Finally, in October—when Judd went on the record about Weinstein's behavior in the New York Times , the first star to do so—the world listened. (Weinstein said he ""never laid a glove"" on Judd and denies having had nonconsensual sex with other accusers.)

When movie stars don't know where to go, what hope is there for the rest of us? What hope is there for the janitor who's being harassed by a co-worker but remains silent out of fear she'll lose the job she needs to support her children? For the administrative assistant who repeatedly fends off a superior who won't take no for an answer? For the hotel housekeeper who never knows, as she goes about replacing towels and cleaning toilets, if a guest is going to corner her in a room she can't escape?

Like the ""problem that has no name,"" the disquieting malaise of frustration and repression among postwar wives and homemakers identified by Betty Friedan more than 50 years ago, this moment is born of a very real and potent sense of unrest. Yet it doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it.

This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.

Emboldened by Judd, Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers, women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate, abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they've faced. When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door. When a movie star says #MeToo, it becomes easier to believe the cook who's been quietly enduring for years.

'WERE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL SOME FANTASY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MOVIEDOM?' Ashley Judd 49 Actor More Judd says she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was 29 years old. ‘ We need to formalize the whisper network. It's an ingenious way that we've tried to keep ourselves safe. All those voices can be amplified. That's my advice to women. That and if something feels wrong, it is wrong—and it's wrong by my definition and not necessarily someone else's. ’ Weinstein said in a statement he 'never laid a glove' on Judd.

The women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City's regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They're part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.

II

In a windowless room at a two-story soundstage in San Francisco's Mission District, a group of women from different worlds met for the first time. Judd, every bit the movie star in towering heels, leaned in to shake hands with Isabel Pascual, a woman from Mexico who works picking strawberries and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family. Beside her, Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, eight months pregnant, spoke softly with Adama Iwu, a corporate lobbyist in Sacramento. A young hospital worker who had flown in from Texas completed the circle. She too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out.

From a distance, these women could not have looked more different. Their ages, their families, their religions and their ethnicities were all a world apart. Their incomes differed not by degree but by universe: Iwu pays more in rent each month than Pascual makes in two months.

But on that November morning, what separated them was less important than what brought them together: a shared experience. Over the course of six weeks, TIME interviewed dozens of people representing at least as many industries, all of whom had summoned extraordinary personal courage to speak out about sexual harassment at their jobs. They often had eerily similar stories to share.

In almost every case, they described not only the vulgarity of the harassment itself—years of lewd comments, forced kisses, opportunistic gropes—but also the emotional and psychological fallout from those advances. Almost everybody described wrestling with a palpable sense of shame. Had she somehow asked for it? Could she have deflected it? Was she making a big deal out of nothing?

""I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react?"" says the anonymous hospital worker who fears for her family's livelihood should her story come out in her small community. ""I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.?"" It's a poisonous, useless thought, she adds, but how do you avoid it? She remembers the shirt she was wearing that day. She can still feel the heat of her harasser's hands on her body.

Alyssa Milano 44 Actor More Millions of people responded with the hashtag #MeToo when Milano urged them to post their experiences on Twitter. ‘ It's affected me on a cellular level to hear all these stories. I don't know if I'll ever be the same. I have not stopped crying. I look at my daughter and think, Please, let this be worth it. Please, let it be that my daughter never has to go through anything like this. ’ Tarana Burke 44 Activist More Burke, founder of a nonprofit that helps survivors of sexual violence, created the Me Too movement in 2006 to encourage young women to show solidarity with one another. It went viral this year after actor Alyssa Milano used the hashtag #MeToo. ‘ Sexual harassment does bring shame. And I think it's really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator. ’

Nearly all of the people TIME interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up.

For some, the fear was born of a threat of physical violence. Pascual felt trapped and terrified when her harasser began to stalk her at home, but felt she was powerless to stop him. If she told anyone, the abuser warned her, he would come after her or her children.

Those who are often most vulnerable in society—immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people—described many types of dread. If they raised their voices, would they be fired? Would their communities turn against them? Would they be killed? According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 47% of transgender people report being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, both in and out of the workplace.

'HE SAID IF I EVER WRONGED HIM, HE WOULD HAVE ME KIDNAPPED, HAVE MY EYES GOUGED OUT WITH A BIC PEN AND THROW ME INTO THE HUDSON RIVER.' Selma Blair 45 Actor More After director James Toback denied accusations by dozens of women that he had sexually assaulted them, Blair spoke out about her encounter with him. ‘ I decided to go on the record when I saw his denial. He called the women liars. But their stories were so similar to mine, and they were such credible women. There was no agenda other than they wanted to share this story, be free of this story. And in a magazine interview, he called the people who said this about him 'c-nts' and 'c-cksuckers.' That was just wrong. And I wanted to give a face to these now more than 300 women who have come out. ’ Toback has denied all allegations of harassment.

Juana Melara, who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for decades, says she and her fellow housekeepers didn't complain about guests who exposed themselves or masturbated in front of them for fear of losing the paycheck they needed to support their families. Melara recalls ""feeling the pressure of someone's eyes"" on her as she cleaned a guest's room. When she turned around, she remembers, a man was standing in the doorway, blocked by the cleaning cart, with his erect penis exposed. She yelled at the top of her lungs and scared him into leaving, then locked the door behind him. ""Nothing happened to me that time, thank God,"" she recalls.

While guests come and go, some employees must continue to work side by side with their harassers. Crystal Washington was thrilled when she was hired as a hospitality coordinator at the Plaza, a storied hotel whose allure is as strong for people who want to work there as it is for those who can afford a suite. ""Walking in, it's breathtaking,"" she says.

But then, she says, a co-worker began making crude remarks to her like ""I can tell you had sex last night"" and groping her. One of those encounters was even caught on camera, but the management did not properly respond, her lawyers say.

Plaza Hotel Plaintiffs More From left: Veronica Owusu, Gabrielle Eubank, Crystal Washington, Dana Lewis, Paige Rodriguez, Sergeline Bernadeau and Kristina Antonova filed a suit against New York City's Plaza Hotel for 'normalizing and trivializing sexual assault' among employees there. ‘ 'I am a single mother. I have an 11-year-old daughter, and she's depending on me,' says Lewis, who still works at the hotel to make ends meet. 'My entire life revolves around her. I wasn't really left with the option of leaving. I'm not left with the option of giving up. I want to show her that it's O.K. to stand up for yourself. If you keep fighting, eventually you'll see the sun on the other side.' ’ Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.

Washington has joined with six other female employees to file a sexual-harassment suit against the hotel. But she cannot afford to leave the job and says she must force herself out of bed every day to face the man she's accused. ""It's a dream to be an employee there,"" Washington says. ""And then you find out what it really is, and it's a nightmare."" (Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said in a statement to TIME that it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.)

Other women, like the actor Selma Blair, weathered excruciating threats. Blair says she arrived at a hotel restaurant for a meeting with the independent film director James Toback in 1999 only to be told that he would like to see her in his room. There, she says, Toback told her that she had to learn to be more vulnerable in her craft and asked her to strip down. She took her top off. She says he then propositioned her for sex, and when she refused, he blocked the door and forced her to watch him masturbate against her leg. Afterward, she recalls him telling her that if she said anything, he would stab her eyes out with a Bic pen and throw her in the Hudson River.

Blair says Toback lorded the encounter over her for decades. ""I had heard from others that he was slandering me, saying these sexual things about me, and it just made me even more afraid of him,"" Blair says in an interview with TIME. ""I genuinely thought for almost 20 years, He's going to kill me."" ( Toback has denied the allegations, saying he never met his accusers or doesn't remember them.)

Many of the people who have come forward also mentioned a different fear, one less visceral but no less real, as a reason for not speaking out: if you do, your complaint becomes your identity. ""'Susan Fowler, the famous victim of sexual harassment,'"" says the woman whose blog post ultimately led Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign and the multibillion-dollar startup to oust at least 20 other employees. ""Nobody wants to be the buzzkill,"" adds Lindsey Reynolds, one of the women who blew the whistle on a culture of harassment at the restaurant group run by the celebrity chef John Besh. (The Besh Group says it is implementing new policies to create a culture of respect. Besh apologized for ""unacceptable behavior"" and ""moral failings,"" and resigned from the company. )

Iwu, the lobbyist, says she considered the same risks after she was groped in front of several colleagues at an event. She was shocked when none of her male co-workers stepped in to stop the assault. The next week, she organized 147 women to sign an open letter exposing harassment in California government. When she told people about the campaign, she says they were wary. ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" they warned her. ""Remember Anita Hill.""

Sara Gelser 43 State Senator More After the Oregon state senator accused her fellow legislator Jeff Kruse of sexual harassment, the statehouse launched an investigation and stripped him of his committee assignments. ‘ We can't pick and choose based on whose political beliefs we believe in. And that means we have to be willing to speak out when it's a member of our own party. ’ Kruse said in a statement that he never touched Gelser inappropriately. Anonymous 28 Hospital worker More The mother of two told the HR department at the hospital where she worked that an executive there repeatedly came on to her. ‘ I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react? Why couldn't I force words out of my mouth? When I got home, I crumbled. I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.? ’

Taylor Swift says she was made to feel bad about the consequences that her harasser faced. After she complained about a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller, who reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end, Mueller was fired. He sued Swift for millions in damages. She countersued for a symbolic $1 and then testified about the incident in August. Mueller's lawyer asked her, on the witness stand, whether she felt bad that she'd gotten him fired.

""I'm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault,"" she told the lawyer. ""I'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine."" (Mueller said he would appeal.)

In an interview with TIME , Swift says that moment on the stand fueled her indignation. ""I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances,"" she says, ""imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance."" Like the five women gathered at that echoing soundstage in San Francisco, and like all of the dozens, then hundreds, then millions of women who came forward with their own stories of harassment, she was done feeling intimidated. Actors and writers and journalists and dishwashers and fruit pickers alike: they'd had enough. What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage. Fear became fury.

'WHEN I TESTIFIED, I HAD ALREADY HAD TO WATCH THIS MAN'S ATTORNEY BULLY, BADGER AND HARASS MY TEAM, INCLUDING MY MOTHER ... I WAS ANGRY.' Taylor Swift 27 Singer-Songwriter More Radio DJ David Mueller groped Swift during a photo op in 2013. She reported him to his radio station, KYGO, and he was terminated. He said her accusations were false and sued Swift. She countersued for $1 and won. ‘ In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn't considered any formalities when he assaulted me ... Why should I be polite? ’ Mueller's lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

This was the great unleashing that turned the #MeToo hashtag into a rallying cry. The phrase was first used more than a decade ago by social activist Tarana Burke as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault. A friend of the actor Alyssa Milano sent her a screenshot of the phrase, and Milano, almost on a whim, tweeted it out on Oct. 15. ""If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet,"" she wrote, and then went to sleep. She woke up the next day to find that more than 30,000 people had used #MeToo. Milano burst into tears.

At first, those speaking out were mostly from the worlds of media and entertainment, but the hashtag quickly spread. ""We have to keep our focus on people of different class and race and gender,"" says Burke, who has developed a friendship with Milano via text messages. By November, California farmworkers, Pascual among them, were marching on the streets of Hollywood to express their solidarity with the stars.

Women were no longer alone. ""There's something really empowering about standing up for what's right,"" says Fowler, who has grown comfortable with her new reputation as a whistle-blower. ""It's a badge of honor.""

Sandra Pezqueda 37 Former Dishwasher More Pezqueda filed a suit alleging that her supervisor at the Terranea Resort, a luxury retreat in South California, pursued her for months. When she rebuffed him, he changed her schedule and cut her hours. ‘ Someone who is in the limelight is able to speak out more easily than people who are poor. The reality of being a woman is the same—the difference is the risk each woman must take. ’ Attorneys for the staffing company that employed Pezqueda deny her allegations. Terranea Resort declined to comment except to say that the suit involves an outside agency. Blaise Godbe Lipman 28 Director More Lipman accused a former agent, Tyler Grasham, of sexually assaulting him when he was 18. Grasham has since been dismissed by his agency and is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department. ‘ I experienced a little bit of victim blaming, victim shaming—people digging into my Instagram and pulling up sexy photos, as if that discredited me from speaking out against sexual violence. And gay men are often highly sexualized in the media, so coming out with a story of sexual assault, especially one that also involved alcohol and maybe drugs, there is an idea that 'Well, did you want it?.' ’ Grasham could not be reached for comment. Correction: The original version of this caption incorrectly said Tyler Grasham was Lipman’s agent. Grasham never represented Lipman.

Discussions of sexual harassment in polite company tend to rely on euphemisms: harassment becomes ""inappropriate behavior,"" assault becomes ­""misconduct,"" rape becomes ""abuse."" We're accustomed to hearing those softened words, which downplay the pain of the experience. That's one of the reasons why the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced in October 2016 was such a jolt. The language used by the man who would become America's 45th President, captured on a 2005 recording, was, by any standard, vulgar. He didn't just say that he'd made a pass; he ""moved on her like a bitch."" He didn't just talk about fondling women; he bragged that he could ""grab 'em by the pussy.""

That Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women's March the day after his Inauguration. It's why women seized on that crude word as the emblem of the protest that dwarfed Trump's Inauguration crowd size. ""All social movements have highly visible precipitating factors,"" says Aldon Morris, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University. ""In this case, you had Harvey Weinstein, and before that you had Trump.""

Megyn Kelly, the NBC anchor who revealed in October that she had complained to Fox News executives about Bill O'Reilly's treatment of women, and who was a target of Trump's ire during the campaign, says the tape as well as the tenor of the election turned the political into the personal. ""I have real doubts about whether we'd be going through this if Hillary Clinton had won, because I think that President Trump's election in many ways was a setback for women,"" says Kelly, who noted that not all women at the march were Clinton supporters. ""But the overall message to us was that we don't really matter.""

'WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY NICE.' Rose McGowan 44 Artist and Activist More McGowan reached a settlement with producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997 after accusing him of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room. McGowan's decision to speak to the press this year helped expose Weinstein as a serial harasser. ‘ The number of people sharing their stories with me is so intense, especially since all of this is incredibly triggering for me as well. People forget a lot that there's a human behind this, someone who is very hurt. But that's O.K. It fuels my fire. They really f-cked with the wrong person. ’ Weinstein has denied all allegations of non­consensual sex.

So it was not entirely surprising that 2017 began with women donning ""pussy hats"" and marching on the nation's capital in a show of unity and fury. What was startling was the size of the protest. It was one of the largest in U.S. history and spawned satellite marches in all 50 states and more than 50 other countries.

Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice , was one of roughly 20 women to accuse the President of sexual harassment. She filed a defamation suit against Trump days before his Inauguration after he disputed her claims by calling her a liar. A New York judge is expected to decide soon if the President is immune to civil suits while in office. No matter the outcome, the allegations added fuel to a growing fire.

By February, the movement had made its way to the billionaire dream factories of Silicon Valley, when Fowler spoke out about her ""weird year"" as an engineer at Uber. ""I remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,"" Fowler says. ""I felt like I had to take action.""

Barely two months later, Fox News cut ties with O'Reilly after the New York Times reported that he and the company had spent $13 million to settle claims against him from five women. In October, the Times revealed a sixth settlement, bringing that total to more than $45 million. Wendy Walsh, a psychologist and former guest on the network, was one of the first women to share her story about the star anchor—but she was initially reluctant to go on the record. ""I was afraid for my kids, I was afraid of the retaliation,"" she says. ""I know what men can do when they're angry.""

Eventually she allowed her name to be used. ""I felt it was my duty,"" Walsh says, ""as a mother of daughters, as an act of love for women everywhere and the women who are silenced, to be brave.""

The downfall of O'Reilly, who has denied all allegations of harassment, would prove to be just the beginning of the reckoning in media and entertainment. In June, Bill Cosby was brought to trial on charges that he had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman named Andrea Constand, one of nearly 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault over several decades. Although the case ended in a mistrial—it is scheduled to be retried in April—the fact that it happened at all signaled a shift in the culture, a willingness to hold even beloved and powerful men accountable for past misdeeds.

Wendy Walsh 55 Former Fox News Contributor More After Walsh and other women accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, Fox News fired him. ‘ In the early '90s, as a news anchor, I wore buttoned-up suits, skirts to my knees, sensible shoes. I dipped out of the industry. When I came back, I was put in a sausage dress. The hair got blonder and the cleavage got deeper and the heels higher. Fox had created a sort of Snapchat filter: any woman, even a woman with advanced degrees, would be turned into what looked like an office sex toy. Part of what happened to the women at Fox News started in the makeup room. ’ O'Reilly has denied harassing colleagues. Lindsey Reynolds 32 Food-Blog Editor More When she quit her job as social-media manager at the restaurant group of celebrity chef John Besh, Reynolds sent an email to her bosses complaining about the company's culture of sexism. She later filed a complaint with the EEOC. Besh has since stepped down. ‘ After I sent that email, I burst into tears and felt sick to my stomach and was shaking. I was nobody. I'm just a person from a small town in Texas. I have no money, no power, no social standing. And they have more power and money than I will ever have. I felt extremely vulnerable and scared. Then I heard from women I had never met—they worked as line cooks while I worked in corporate—who had experienced the same toxic culture. ’ The company said it is working to enact policies to create a culture of safety and respect. Besh has apologized for 'unacceptable' behavior and 'moral failings,' and resigned.

Complaints at the University of Rochester helped expose harassment in academia. The chief executive of SoFi, the $4 billion lending firm, resigned following a lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment. Then, in early October, the dam finally broke.

On Oct. 5, the New York Times published the first story to expose Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and a leading Democratic political fundraiser, as a serial sexual predator. The revelation was quickly followed by New Yorker investigations that widened Weinstein's list of accusers and showed the incredible lengths he went to cover his tracks. Weinstein denied the allegations, but the levers that he had long pulled to exert his influence suddenly were jammed. Fellow chieftains refused to defend him. Politicians who once courted him gave away his donations. His company's board fired him.

Within days, the head of Amazon Studios, an influential art publisher and employees at the financial-services firm Fidelity had all left their jobs over harassment claims. By the end of the month, the list of the accused had grown to include political analyst Mark Halperin, a former TIME employee; opinion-shaping literary critic Leon Wieseltier; and numerous politicians and journalists. The Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey was scrubbed from a completed movie.

'IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY CRITICIZE ME. I CAN SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.' Isabel Pascual 42 Strawberry picker More In the wake of the revelations about Harvey Weinstein, Pascual spoke out at a march in L.A. about being stalked and harassed in order to give voice to her fellow agricultural workers. ‘ I was afraid. When the man was harassing me, he threatened to harm my children and me—that's why I kept quiet. I felt desperate. I cried and cried. But, thank God, my friends in the fields support me. So I said, Enough. I lost the fear. It doesn't matter if they criticize me. I can support other people who are going through the same thing. ’ *Pascual's name was changed to protect her family.

The response to the Weinstein allegations has shaped the way people view women who come forward. In a TIME/SurveyMonkey online poll of American adults conducted Nov. 28–30, 82% of respondents said women are more likely to speak out about harassment since the Weinstein allegations. Meanwhile, 85% say they believe the women making allegations of sexual harassment.

The movement—and fallout—quickly spread around the world. Michael Fallon, Britain's Defense Secretary, quit the Cabinet after journalist Jane Merrick revealed that he had ""lunged"" at her in 2003, when she was a 29-year-old reporter. In France, women took to the streets chanting not only ""Me too"" but also ""Balance ton porc ,"" which translates roughly to ""Expose your pig,"" a hashtag conceived by French journalist Sandra Muller. In the week after #MeToo first surfaced, versions of it swept through 85 countries, from India, where the struggle against harassment and assault had already become a national debate in recent years, to the Middle East, Asia and parts in between.

Lindsay Meyer 31 Entrepreneur More Meyer says that Justin Caldbeck, a venture capitalist who invested in her first company, harassed her. After six other women reported harassment by Caldbeck, he resigned from his firm. ‘ I wanted it to stop. I wanted to be able to get back to running my company and not have the daily distraction of being constantly emailed, called, text-messaged. That took a lot of energy to deal with and to process and to try to bury—because I didn't want it to be a big deal. For so long, I went around harboring this ridiculous belief that because I was a nonwhite woman in my 20s that somehow it was expected that I would have to be treated this way. And now I see that that is so silly. I am a person with dignity. ’ Caldbeck apologized in a statement to the women he 'made uncomfortable.' Juana Melara 52 Housekeeper More Hotel guests have propositioned and exposed themselves to Melara while she was working. ‘ One time when I was cleaning, a guest asked me if I knew how to massage. I said, 'No, I don't even do it to my husband.' The way he was looking at me wasn't friendly. I rushed to finish the room as fast as I could and get out of there. It's crazy that people think that if they pay for the room, they are paying for sexual service. ’ The hotel declined to comment.

""Suddenly,"" says Terry Reintke, a German member of the European Parliament, who discussed her own harassment in a speech on Oct. 25, ""friends from primary school or women that I know from completely different surroundings that would never call themselves feminists were starting to share their stories.""

By November, the spotlight was back on American politicians. A woman named Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post that Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican nominee for the Senate, abused her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Nine women have come forward to describe inappropriate encounters with Roy Moore, including several who say he pursued them when they were teenagers. Moore has called the allegations ""false"" and ""malicious."" ""Specifically, I do not know any of these women nor have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any woman,"" he said in late November.

'I'M SURE THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND DIFFICULT, BUT IT WILL BE POSITIVE IN THE END.' Sandra Muller 46 Journalist More In France, Muller started the Twitter hashtag #BalanceTonPorc (Expose Your Pig), which helped inspire women to march in the streets to protest sexual harassment. ‘ France is a country of love, but there is love and love, you know? There are ways to approach a woman, and if it's done with respect, it's O.K. Without respect, it's not good. Now if men want your love, they have to ask themselves how to be, how to approach a woman. They are scared. We must restart all relationships from the beginning. We have to cleanse society to find a better way. I'm sure the road will be long and difficult, but it will be positive in the end. ’

The following week, radio host Leeann Tweeden wrote that Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken groped her on a USO tour in 2006, before he was in office. Several other women have since come forward with similar harassment allegations against Franken, who has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate his own behavior. On Dec. 5, Michigan Democratic Representative John Conyers resigned amid allegations that he had made sexual advances toward the women on his staff. He has said that the allegations ""are not accurate; they are not true.""

Texas Republican Representative Blake Farenthold has also found himself in the crosshairs after media reports that he used $84,000 in taxpayer dollars to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit with a former aide in 2014. Farenthold denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing and has vowed to repay the settlement.

'WHEN TRUMP WON THE ELECTION, I FELT A CRUSHING SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.' Susan Fowler 26 Former Uber Engineer More Fowler's February blog post about the harassment she experienced as an engineer at Uber went viral. Uber then launched an investigation that led to the ousting of its CEO Travis Kalanick and more than 20 other employees. ‘ When other women spoke out, they were retaliated against. So there were certain things that I thought I could avoid: 'I'm not going to sue, because they'll make me sign a non­disclosure agreement. I'm not going to do press right afterward, because they'll say I'm doing it for attention. I can't have any emotion in my blog. I have to be very, very detached.' And I had to make sure that every single thing that I included in there had extensive physical documentation, so it couldn't be 'he said, she said.' And that's what I did. ’

The accused were both Democrats and Republicans, but the consequences thus far have been limited—and often filtered through a partisan lens. In politics, at least, what constitutes disqualifying behavior seemed to depend not on your actions but on the allegiance of your tribe. In the 1990s, feminists stood up for accused abuser Bill Clinton instead of his ­accusers—a move many are belatedly regretting as the national conversation prompts a re-evaluation of the claims against the former President. And despite the allegations against Moore, both ­President Trump and the Republican National Committee support him.

That political divide was revealed in the TIME/SurveyMonkey poll, which found that Republicans were significantly more likely to excuse sexual misdeeds in their own party. The survey found that while a majority of Republicans and Democrats agree that a Democratic Congressman accused of sexual harassment should resign (71% and 74% respectively), when the accused offender was in the GOP, only 54% of Republicans would demand a resignation (compared to 82% of Democrats).

'WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING THE VICTIM HERE? LET'S FLIP IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PREDATOR IS DOING.' Terry Crews 49 Actor More Crews is suing agent Adam Venit and William Morris Endeavor for sexual assault. Crews says Venit groped him in front of his wife at an industry event. Venit was briefly suspended from the agency. ‘ People were saying, 'You should have beaten him up.' I'm like, Why is nobody questioning him? Nobody questions the predator. You know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, 'No more.' Why are you questioning the victim here? Let's flip it. Let's talk about what the predator is doing. ’ The agency said it had suspended and demoted Venit, who declined to comment.

As another election cycle approaches, Americans find themselves trying to weigh one ugly act against another in a painful calculus of transgression. Is a grope caught on camera more disqualifying than a years-ago assault that was credibly reported? What are we willing to forgive or ignore or deny if the violator shares our politics?

It wasn't so long ago that the boss chasing his secretary around the desk was a comic trope, a staple from vaudeville to prime-time sitcoms. There wasn't even a name for sexual harassment until just over 40 years ago; the term was coined in 1975 by a group of women at Cornell University after an employee there, Carmita Wood, filed for unemployment benefits after she had resigned because a supervisor touched her. The university denied her claim, arguing that she left the job for ""personal reasons.""

University Professors More University of Rochester professors Celeste Kidd (right) and Jessica Cantlon (left), along with six current and former members of the brain and cognitive sciences department, filed complaints with the university and the EEOC, alleging harassment and retaliation. ‘ 'If they couldn't stop us from talking, they were going to stop every­body from listening,' says Cantlon. 'The administration went into our emails to try to find pieces of material that they could use to embarrass us or try to make other faculty members angry with us. But eight of us linked arms and continued to pursue the complaint. I think working together was powerful. It was hard to silence all of us.' ’ The university has launched an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.

Wood, joined by activists from the university's human-affairs program, formed a group called Working Women United that hosted an event for workers from various fields, from mail-room clerks and servers to factory workers and administrative assistants, to talk about their own harassment experiences.

It was a proto-version of the social-media explosion we're seeing today, encouraging unity and reminding women that they were not alone. But even as public awareness about the problem of sexual harassment began to grow, legal and policy protections were almost nonexistent. In the 1970s, most businesses and institutions had no policies on sexual harassment whatsoever, and even egregious complaints were regularly dismissed.

'I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR MY DAUGHTER. I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR ME.' Megyn Kelly 47 Journalist More The host of NBC's Megyn Kelly Today and former Fox News anchor called out Bill O'Reilly for claiming that nobody at Fox News had complained about his behavior. She had. In 2016, Kelly revealed that she'd been sexually harassed by former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. ‘ I always thought maybe things could change for my daughter. I never thought things could change for me. Never. I believed the system was stacked against women, and the smart ones would understand how to navigate it ... I'm starting to see it so differently. What if we did complain? What if we didn't whine, but insisted that those around us did better? ’ Ailes denied Kelly's claims of harassment before he died in May. O'Reilly said he didn't know of any complaint by Kelly.

In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, issued guidelines declaring sexual harassment a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It was a victory, but with caveats: even after sexual harassment became explicitly illegal, it remained difficult to lodge a complaint that stuck—in part because acts of harassment are often difficult to define. What separates an illegal act of sexual harassment from a merely annoying interaction between a boss and his subordinate? When does a boss stop just being a jerk and become a criminal? Because the Civil Rights Act offered no solid legal definition, interpretation has evolved slowly, shaped by judges and the EEOC over the past 37 years.

In 1991, Anita Hill testified before the Senate committee confirming Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual harassment and bringing national attention to the issue. But, she says, ""The conversation was not about the problems in the workplace. It was about the fallout in politics.""

More From left: Jane Merrick, journalist; Zelda Perkins, producer; Terry Reintke, Parliament member; Bex Bailey, charity worker. ‘ Britain's Defense Secretary Michael Fallon quit his Cabinet position after Merrick said he 'lunged' at her when she was a young reporter: 'I think we're all part of this movement. On Twitter, there aren't any country borders, because it's such a powerful thing. There are millions of women who have experienced harassment and assault in every country.” ’ Fallon said in a statement that he's 'behaved inappropriately in the past.' Kate Peters for TIME

Even now, the contours of what constitutes sexual harassment remain murky. Some of the recent stories clearly cross the line, like a boss exposing himself to a subordinate or requiring that his researcher sit on his lap. But others feel more ambiguous. Under what circumstances can you ask a colleague about their marriage? When is an invite to drinks alone a bridge too far?

Jonathan Segal, a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Duane Morris, who specializes in workplace training, says he hears that confusion in the conversations men are now having among themselves. ""It's more like, 'I wonder if I should tell someone they look nice, I wonder when it's O.K. to give a hug, I wonder when I should be alone with someone in a room,'"" he says.

Amanda Schmitt 30 Art curator More A publisher of Artforum, Knight Landesman, stepped down after Schmitt sued him for sexual harassment. ‘ The harassment started when I was at the beginning of my career and had just moved to New York City. I was trying to figure out my place in the art world, my place in the city, my place as an adult in the workplace. The harassment began so early, and it was so accepted in the industry. When I finally spoke out publicly, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. I was afraid that I didn't have the strength to make it stop. I don't feel that fear anymore. ’ Artforum's other publishers say they took swift action to support Schmitt. Landesman could not be reached for comment. Adama Iwu 40 Lobbyist More Iwu organized an open letter signed by 147 women calling out harassment in California's capital, which launched a state-senate investigation. ‘ Young women told me about the same men who harassed me years ago. And all I did was participate in the whisper network: 'Here's what you can wear,' 'Here's where you can go,' 'Here's who to avoid.' But you have to address it head on and as a group. It's hard to call 147 women liars. We can't all be crazy. We can't all be sluts. ’

This uncertainty can be corrosive. While everyone wants to smoke out the serial predators and rapists, there is a risk that the net may be cast too far. What happens when someone who makes a sexist joke winds up lumped into the same bucket as a boss who gropes an employee? Neither should be encouraged, but nor should they be equated.

Companies, meanwhile, are scrambling to keep up. Most large U.S.-based corporations now have fairly complete policies on sexual harassment, and many have anti–sexual harassment training programs and claim to be ""zero-­tolerance workplaces."" A 2016 EEOC report found that a company's willingness to protect so-called rainmakers—high-performing men like Kalanick, Weinstein and O'Reilly—to be one of the most pernicious reasons C-­suites and corporate boards overlooked harassment. It doesn't matter how good a company's policy is if its systems are ignored or don't work. ""So much harassment training is like an episode of The Office ,"" says Victoria Lipnic, the acting chair of the EEOC.

In some instances, sexual-harassment training has even been shown to backfire. In a 2001 study, Lisa Scherer, an associate professor of industrial-organizational psychology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, found that while training increased knowledge about what constituted sexual harassment, it also sometimes had a corrosive effect on workplace culture. ""What was disturbing was that the males who had gone through training showed a backlash effect,"" she says. ""They said they were less willing to report sexual harassment than the males who had not gone through the training.""

Employers are also girding for future allegations and lawsuits. The insurance company Nationwide reported a 15% increase in sales of employment practices liability insurances between 2016 and 2017. And Advisen, which tracks insurance trends, says that EPLI insurance price has increased 30% since 2011, which indicates that more companies are reporting losses.

Corporate boards, wary of alienating female employees and customers and of drawing bad press, have been among the quickest to make changes. Uber, for example, which built its reputation on a willingness to flout norms, used to be a guiding light for small startups. Now nobody is pitching their company as the next Uber, says Fowler. ""There's a shift to, 'We're not disrupting anymore. We're trying to build something that's good for consumers and treats employees fairly.'"" It's a start.

State and local governments have also taken some concrete steps. In October, the Chicago city council passed an ordinance­ requiring hotels to provide panic buttons to employees who work alone in hotel rooms. In Springfield, Ill., lawmakers passed a measure that will allow an investigation into a backlog of sexual-­harassment complaints in the statehouse. In Arizona, pending legislation would void nondisclosure agreements signed by victims of harassment to keep them silent.

'I STAYED ANONYMOUS BECAUSE I LIVE IN A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. AND THEY JUST THINK USUALLY THAT WE'RE LYING AND COMPLAINERS.' Anonymous 22 Former office assistant More After a co-worker allegedly began kissing and pressing himself on her, this young Native American woman says she felt trapped. Her office had no HR department. She didn't feel her colleagues or family on her small, conservative reservation would believe her. So she quit her job. ‘ On the reservation, we keep to ourselves and don't really put too much out there. I thought of all the other people that had no voice. They're scared to do something like this because their parents say, 'You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to speak up.' ’

At the federal level, the House and Senate have passed new rules requiring members of Congress and their staff to complete mandatory sexual-harassment training. A handful of Senators have also introduced legislation to rein in what are known as mandatory arbitration agreements—legal clauses that can appear in employee contracts that prevent workers from suing their employers in court for any reason, including sexual harassment. Some 60 million American workers are currently bound by them.

We're still at the bomb-throwing point of this revolution, a reactive stage at which nuance can go into hiding. But while anger can start a revolution, in its most raw and feral form it can't negotiate the more delicate dance steps needed for true social change. Private conversations, which can't be legislated or enforced, are essential.

Norms evolve, and it's long past time for any culture to view harassment as acceptable. But there's a great deal at stake in how we assess these new boundaries—for women and men together. We can and should police criminal acts and discourage inappropriate, destructive behavior.

At least we've started asking the right questions. Ones that seem alarmingly basic in hindsight: ""What if we did complain?"" proposes Megyn Kelly. ""What if we didn't whine, but we spoke our truth in our strongest voices and insisted that those around us did better? What if that worked to change reality right now?"" Kelly acknowledges that this still feels more like a promise than a certainty. But for the moment, the world is listening.

DeMille Award during the 75th Golden Globe Awards on January 7, 2018, in Beverly Hills, California. / AFP PHOTO / Frederic J. BROWN (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images)

There’s no endorsement a retail product wants more in the holiday shopping season than a spot on Oprah’s Favorite Things. This year, 107 products have received the Winfrey push, the biggest list ever.

Winfrey has released this year’s list in the upcoming issue of her magazine O, and among the big-name winners are Amazon (which not only got a shout out for its Echo Spot, but is once again partnering with Winfrey to let people buy the products she favored), Lands End (whose hooded winter coat got a nod) and Samsung (for the second year in a row, its Q7FN QLED TV, which displays artwork when it’s turned off, made the list).

That’s all well and good if you’re Oprah rich. But for the rest of us, gathering those things is going to put a major dent in our bank account.

All totaled, purchasing each of the 107 items will run you just shy of $16,000. (Some of the items, though, are currently offering discounts that could lower that total a bit.) That’s about $2,000 more than the grand total of last year’s list.

Perhaps mindful of that price tag, this year’s Oprah’s Favorite Things list also keeps budget-restricted shoppers in mind, with 50 items below $50.

So what’s driving the price up? Here are a few of the more notable items:

Story Bikes Electric Step-Through Bike

This unisex bike not only lets you cruise around town at speeds of up to 20mph, it also includes a USB outlet to charge your phone and will go up to 45 miles on a single charge. It’ll run you $1,695 normally.

Izola Cocktail Straws

As restaurant chains do away with straws, Winfrey is promoting these copper plated, stainless steel reusable ones, which carry a $20 price tag.

Pitcher No. Nine Hundred Seventy One

Pour your lemonade from this $198 pitcher, which also doubles as a decorative vase.

Carl the Drinking Chocolate Snowman

We love hot cocoa too, but $38 seems a bit high for five to eight cups.

Popinsanity Artisanal Popcorn Multi-Flavored Popcorn Tin

Same thinking as with Carl above. Popcorn. Great! $180 popcorn? What?",1

The Flip or Flop star's toddler actually fell into a pool while being watched by a nanny, according to E! News.

""Thankfully all is fine and Brayden is doing great,"" a source told E! News. ""He's his happy, healthy self and Christina was being overly cautious by taking him to the hospital to be checked out.""

While the original Instagram post that Christina posted of her son next to the pool has since been deleted, according to Entertainment Tonight, one commenter wrote, ""as a mother it is scary to have a toddler being that close to a pool!""

Christina wrote back to the comments, saying, ""OMG 1. It's a beach entry if he fell in it's only a foot high, he would be ok 2. It's not his first time in or around the pool, but thanks for your ""concern"" aka judgment 3. AND most importantly I am right there and could be to him in 3 seconds SMH at this .....!!!!""

While Child Protective Services was called to the hospital to question El Moussa and the nanny after Brayden fell into the pool, no actions were taken against the family, TMZ reports.

John Ratzenberger's underground-obsessed antagonist didn't look like he'd be easy to defeat, but as far as the wider Incredibles 2 story goes, he's not serving as the lead villain. Disney and Pixar have been staying silent about just who the main threat in this movie is, but we finally have our first look at this mysterious baddie thanks to the latest Incredibles 2 poster. Suit up. A new #Incredibles2 trailer debuts tomorrow! ???? pic.twitter.com/8hjMUTzlIg — Disney•Pixar (@DisneyPixar) April 12, 2018 While Jack-Jack's adversary in Incredibles 2 is presumably that raccoon, judging by how the baby's trying to incinerate the pest with his heat vision, it's the individual above the movie's logo who will be causing trouble for the folks with special abilities. Granted, the poster doesn't technically label them as the villain, but with a look like that, it's hard to imagine they're going around doing good deeds. Are the glowing goggles just for show or do they allow the villain to hypnotize people? Does the villain have any natural superpowers or do they rely solely on technology/other resources? There's still a lot that needs to be revealed, but at least now we have an idea of what Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and the rest of the protagonists will be up against in Incredibles 2. Looking at the background of this new Incredibles 2 poster, you can also make out some of the new superheroes who are being introduced in the sequel. The Incredibles went over how following the public being fed up with collateral damage, superheroes were forced to go into retire from their crimefighting activities and stay hidden in plain sight through their secret identities. However, Incredibles 2 will see a campaign to officially bring back the ""supers"" being launched, with Helen Parr, a.k.a. Elastigirl, spearheading the charge on behalf of businessman Winston Deaver (Bob Odenkirk). One of the new heroes we'll meet in Incredibles 2 is Voyd (Sophia Bush), a longtime Elastigirl fan who can make objects appear and disappear, but the other heroes haven't been officially identified yet. I can't help but worry that one of these ""heroes"" might actually be serving the villain. Just because it's a Pixar movie doesn't mean there can't be deception and betrayal. Incredibles 2 opens in theaters on June 15, so keep checking in with CinemaBlend as we learn more about the new characters appearing in the sequel.

Ever since his firing from ""The Today Show,"" Matt Lauer and his wife Annette Roque had been plagued with divorce rumors but just recently, the couple was spotted spending time together.

Matt Lauer and his model wife Annette Roque were recently spotted spending some time with their daughter, 14-year-old Romy, in a horse farm in New York. which definitely contrasts the speculations that the two are mere moments away from a divorce. Both Lauer and Roque were seen and photographed at Bright Side Farm, a horse training facility that they had opened in 2013. However, while the couple did spend a lot of time there, they arrived separately, with Roque, who was without a wedding ring, arriving first. Both had been there to watch as their daughter rode through the farm.

Their sons Jack and Thijs were visibly absent from the trip, but Lauer would, later on, be seen spending time with them in the Hamptons.

When Lauer was first fired from ""The Today Show,"" news quickly spread that he and his wife of 11 years were divorcing, as caused by the former news anchor's sexual misconduct scandal as well as his affairs with his co-workers. Lauer released a statement after his termination as well as an apology, saying: ""There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry... Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish deeply. Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I am committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full-time job.""

A few days prior to their latest family outing, Annette Roque had been spotted leaving a New York law firm, which had everyone assuming that her agenda there had something to do with the end of her marriage to Lauer.",1
468,"Emma Stone And Andrew Garfield Might Be Giving Their Love A Second Chance Where there was fire, ashes reman!

After officially ending their relationship in 2015, the Amazing Spider-man co-stars joined the small but growing club of celebrities with friendly separations. And it’s only clear that there’s still much love between former couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.

I mean, the guy teared up when she won her Best Actress Academy Award, for crying out loud! And both Emma and Andrew have said in numerous occasions that even after their split, they still love each other very much.

Well, it seems like those weren’t just empty words.

According to The Sun, Stone has been making multiple trips to London to see Garfield perform in his play Angels in America. She’s watched the show several times and allegedly “always” goes back for a backstage visit. “They have even been sneaking out of the back door holding hands,” a source close to Garfield told the outlet.

While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. “Andrew’s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,” the source said.

Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010’s, these two were Hollywood’s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.

Yet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.

“The familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again. So, I wouldn’t say that they are back to being an official couple just yet, but the future is probably going to be something where they are together. It is basically just a matter of time,” the source said.

We choose to remain optimistic!",1
469,"What Did Robert Say To Willow On 'The Royals' Finale? The King's Words Were Extra Convincing Spoilers for The Royals Season 4 finale follow. King Robert has demonstrated before that he can talk his way out of things, but he proves just how smooth he is during The Royals Season 4 finale. Willow chooses to marry Robert on The Royals after she had promised his family to expose his corruptness to the world. Robert speaks to Willow right before their wedding and apparently, whatever he tells her makes Willow change her mind. So what did Robert tell Willow to convince her to marry him? Only a Season 5 could reveal the true answer, but Robert's words were inspired by a vision of his dead father.

Before the wedding, Liam talks to Robert in an effort to make him realize that he would be better as a virtuous king. ""Dad wanted to disband the monarchy because he understood how that kind of power can corrupt even the best of us,"" Liam says. Robert is initially insulted by Liam's insinuations, but he softens when Liam tells him how much he loved and appreciated Robert when Robert was good. Robert then envisions his father, who is the reason Robert is so desperate to be considered a great king. King Simon tells him, ""You know where your salvation lies."" As their conversation continues, it becomes clear that King Simon is saying that Willow is Robert's salvation.

E!

Why Robert chose Willow to be his bride is still a bit of a mystery. Although he claims it's because of how he feels, the previous episode proved that was a lie. He had used Eleanor's letter to Jasper to win back Willow after a fight. And if you genuinely loved someone, you would be able to express yourself without assistance. Willow recognizes this, which is why she decides she can't marry Robert and offers to say that he caused the power outage during the wedding.

But something clicked for Robert after his conversations with Liam and his ghost dad. While Willow waits by herself to walk down the aisle, Robert approaches her — breaking wedding tradition. ""We need to talk,"" Robert says. The Royals doesn't show what he says to her, but one theory is that he is finally honest with Willow. He's been so focused on being a king that he hasn't really opened himself up to actually love her. Does he tell Willow this and show his vulnerable side? Does he say he needs her to make him a better man, as his father said? Is that why she goes through with the marriage?

E!

Well, Robert better have been honest to Willow. Especially since his father had just told him, ""Don't diminish her light with your darkness."" And while it's optimistic to think Robert has decided to be a decent ruler and person, maybe he's not really as bad as his family thinks he is. Willow's face definitely conveys that she's really happy with her decision to say, ""I do.""

Yet, it's Robert's face that people should be paying attention to in that moment. Because while he looks happy, he also looks a bit too pleased with himself. Is that the face of a man who just married the woman he loves? Or is that the face of a man who has just won?

E!

If Robert is still being manipulative, then he could have told Willow what he thought she wanted to hear to ensure she went through with the wedding. Perhaps his conversation with Liam tipped him off that something was amiss, so he did some damage control. Or, there's the option that there's a darkness in Willow too. Both Eleanor and Liam believe that Willow is a decent, trustworthy person. But maybe now that she has gotten this close to marrying the king, his words make her realize she doesn't want to back out now. Her desire to become queen could have overwhelmed her. It would be a drastic shift for the character, but it would make for some excellent drama in a potential Season 5 if King Robert and Queen Wilhelmina ruled the U.K. as an evil power couple.

Speaking of Season 5, what Robert said to Willow before their wedding should be revealed if The Royals gets another season. And at that point, the show should also reveal whether Willow did some talking of her own and exposed Robert's family as traitors.",1

The actor, who reprises his role as supervillain Kylo Ren in the famous franchise, isn’t sure if he’s ready to sit down and review his latest work.

“Undecided,” he told Esquire when asked if he had plans to watch the film.

But his uncertainty should not come as a surprise to those who know the actor. Driver, 34, has long said that he does not enjoy watching himself on screen.

Image zoom Norman Jean Roy

“I can’t just watch it objectively,” he said. “I always hate it and then come back to, like, ‘Okay, that’s fine, it’s not about me. It’s the story.’ I can’t watch it once. I have to watch it five times, you know? The movie is over. It’s on film, so it’s permanent. But if I think about it more, it’s just an obsessive loop I keep playing in my mind that I can’t get caught up in because it’s totally self-destructive and not helpful moving forward.”

But when it came to his first Star Wars film, Driver decided he could make an exception.

“The Force Awakens is the only movie I’ve sat with an audience and watched,” he said. “Joanne [his wife] hadn’t seen it. I didn’t tell her anything about it. I didn’t tell her I kill Han Solo.”

But even then, Driver said the experience was less than pleasant.

“Credits started, the whole scroll at the beginning, and they start screaming, ‘Oh my God! It’s happening,'” he said. “And I flash-forward to where I killed Han, and I got really sick, and went really cold, waiting for when it was over.”

Speaking with GQ about the December party, Haddish claimed that a drugged out actress bit Beyoncé in the face. “She bit Beyoncé in the face,” she says. “Beyoncé stormed away, went up to JAY-Z, and was like, ‘JAY! Come here! This bitch–‘ and snatched him. They went to the back of the room. I was like, ‘What just happened?’ And Beyoncé’s friend walked up and was like, ‘Can you believe this bitch just bit Beyoncé?'”

Kimberly J. Brown, who played heroine Marnie Piper in the first three Halloweentown movies (we do NOT talk about the fourth film), finally confirmed fans' suspicions that she and her Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge co-star, Daniel Kountz, were more than just friends.

For International Kissing Day on Saturday (July 6), Kimberly posted a kiss pic that would make Kalabar's jaw drop. ""#internationalkissingday you say? I’ll just leave this right here then 😏,"" she captioned.

OMG. I ship it so hard. Seriously, they're both so dang cute!

Daniel has been popping up on Kimberly's Instagram more frequently over the past few months. For Halloween last year, they did a couples costume as superheroes. A few months later, they spent Christmas Eve together.

They've hung out in Portland, saw Hamilton, and more recently, attended The Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco's wedding.

Back in 2016, fans first started noticing the DCOM stars had reconnected when Daniel appeared in Kimberly's hilarious short about what really happened to Kal at the end of Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge. (Spoiler: He went to magic rehab.)

A year later, the duo acted onscreen together again in another short that's partly Not Safe for Disney.

Over the weekend, the loved-up pair packed up their bags yet again and headed to Malibu with two of Disick’s children (with ex Kourtney Kardashian), son Mason and daughter Penelope, to enjoy some much-needed R&R.

The 19-year-old star posted a photograph of her beau on Instagram on what appeared to be a hotel bad decorated with a surprise rose petal heart.

‘Omg,’ she captioned the adorable photo.

During their holiday, the father-of-three also took to Instagram to cosy up to his ‘#1’ love, Mason, on the beach.



The couple’s latest holiday comes exactly a month after the pair jetted off to Mexico with Disick’s children – a decision which reportedly annoyed Kourtney.

‘Kourtney and Scott had a major blowout fight over him taking the kids on a spring break trip to Mexico with his girlfriend Sofia,’ a source told HollywoodLife.com.

‘Kourtney thinks it is entirely inappropriate for Scott to taking the kids on international trips with his too-young girlfriend.’

478,"'RHONY' Bad Apple of the Week: Dorinda Has Emotional Breakdown When Bethenny Calls Her 'A Drunk' Dorinda Medley threw back one too many cocktails before heading to Puerto Rico to help Bethenny Frankel with her hurricane relief efforts, and it ended in utter disaster.

The ""Real Housewives of New York"" stars stopped in Miami before taking one of Bethenny's jets and all kinds of aid to Puerto Rico to help the victims of Hurricane Maria. The two had some cocktails in Bethenny's hotel room and a few before dinner before they met up with the rest of the relief crew. By 7 p.m., Dorinda was wasted.

Bethenny was mortified watching Dorinda slur her words, interrupt her friends and make comments like, ""How weird that there's an earthquake in Haiti, right?"" and ""Do you think there's a constructive action to make it, like, ability to sustain itself?""

Bethenny knew Dorinda was drunk, but when she felt Dorinda was questioning the point of going to Puerto Rico in the first place, Bethenny said, ""Maybe you shouldn't come tomorrow if you feel so hopeless about it.""

Dorinda lost it. She stormed off and told Bethenny, ""You always ruin everything.""

Bethenny ended up apologizing to her friends and assuring them that Dorinda would still be coming to Puerto Rico. She told Bravo cams, ""The first feeling that I have is compassion for her, honestly. She won't even know what she's done. I know she'll wake up tomorrow and she'll be there on time and dressed and she'll have a good experience. And I'm forgiving.""

""It's sad because Dorinda seems to abuse alcohol,"" she continued. ""I would say that acting this way at 7 o'clock at night to people who only have good intentions would indicate that there might be a problem.""

The next day on the plane, Bethenny confronted Dorinda, and it was basically an intervention.

BETHENNY: ""I don't want you to get your fur up because I'm gonna be very, very kind. You go to a 16 out of 10, and I need to really say it to you because the way that you sometimes treat me is like worse than Ramona. I just cut you slack because you're a drunk."" DORINDA: ""Well, I'm not, I just can't not eat and then drink. I should've gone to bed last night."" BETHENNY: ""But it was 7 o'clock. You shouldn't be going to bed at 7 o'clock."" DORINDA: ""I know, but I shouldn't have drank at 4. BETHENNY: ""Then you shouldn't be drinking, because when you drink, you get mean. There's something that goes on. You may be allergic. You can't act like that.""

Dorinda said she had ""a lot going on"" in her life, but Bethenny counteracted with, ""So does everybody."" She also told Dorinda she was ""scared of her.""

""I don't think I'm an alcoholic,"" Dorinda replied. ""I think I use alcohol as an excuse to sometimes exhibit bad behavior.""

After the two chatted for a bit, Dorinda's real issue came to the surface: She misses her late husband, Richard, and Bethenny's new boyfriend, Dennis, reminds her of him. In fact, she went as far as to say the resemblence triggered that blowout with Sonja Morgan earlier this season.

""I realized sitting with [Dennis] that he's so much like [Richard],"" Dorinda said as she began to cry. ""I remember this, and at one point, it was real. And I thought it was forever. I have a life now that's not the life that I expected. That's why I think what triggered so much when Sonja was saying the thing about her divorce and stuff.""

""Dorinda's got Richard on her mind, and I think she's chosen a man now that she can be with part time, not someone that she would really be with full time, so she's left thinking about her old life,"" Bethenny said of Dorinda's current boyfriend, John Mahdessian.

Dorinda began to sob as she admitted to feeling like she's sliding backward. She told Bethenny she feels like all her ""major jobs"" -- being a wife and being a mom -- ""are kind of over.""

""As bad as it was that Richard passed and all that bologna, I grew so much,"" Dorinda said. ""Like, the person that stood by his coffin is not the person that I am today, and I would have never become that person if he had lived. Not saying that's a positive thing, but maybe the person that met John 6 or 7 months after Richard died is not that person today. Maybe that person needs a different sort of partner.""

Bethenny agreed: ""I don't think you're fulfilled in that relationship, I'll tell you that.""

""The Real Housewives of New York"" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.

481,"'Grey's Anatomy': Krista Vernoff and Camilla Luddington Go Inside Timely Domestic Abuse Episode The showrunner and star talk with THR about parallels to the sexual harassment ""reckoning"" happening in Hollywood and what's next for Jo.

[This story contains spoilers from Thursday's ""1-800-799-7233"" episode of ABC's Grey's Anatomy.]

In an episode that could have been written post-Harvey Weinstein, ABC's Grey's Anatomy addressed domestic abuse during Thursday's episode in which Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) came face-to-face with her abusive and estranged husband Paul (Matthew Morrison, Glee).

The minute Paul arrives, many of Jo's colleagues are taken with his stature as a famous doctor. That is, until they learn that Jo was a victim of domestic abuse by the renowned surgeon. Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) instantly changes course and supports Jo, refusing to let her be alone in the same room when Paul and his new bride-to-be Jenny (guest star Bethany Joy Lenz, One Tree Hill) come calling with divorce papers.

Jo, realizing that she does not want another woman to suffer the same experience at Paul's hands, does her best to warn Jenny. However, she seems to believe the Paul's spin that Jo is crazy, as he attempted to discredit his estranged wife by calling her a party girl and alcoholic.

After Paul learns of Jo's efforts to get to Jenny, he confronts — and scares the crap — out of Jo, who realizes he now knows where to find her and how to reach her. The episode ends when Paul is shockingly brought back to the hospital as a patient, the victim of a hit-and-run a day after Alex (Justin Chambers) and Jo both said that they wish he was dead.

Below, showrunner Krista Vernoff — who has been outspoken about what Hollywood can do to change its culture of sexual harassment — and star Camilla Luddington talk with THR about the timely storyline, Grey's star Ellen Pompeo's candid interview and what's next for Jo. Also worth noting: The phone number used for the title of Thursday's episode is for the National Domestic Violence Hotline (an idea that co-star Giacomo Gianniotti came up with), as Luddington filmed a PSA for the organization that aired at the end of the episode. Thursday's Grey's also featured an important transgender story in which new intern Casey disclosed some deeply personal information to Bailey. (Click here to read our exclusive interview with Vernoff and co-star Alex Blue Davis.)

How much of the domestic abuse storyline was plotted out before the season started? Did the sexual harassment ""reckoning"" that's happening across the country and in Hollywood play a role in this story at all?

Vernoff: This story was broken before #MeToo and before the Harvey Weinstein story came out. I don't know if I believe in coincidences but it's a fascinating moment of alchemy that these episodes are airing now. I came into this season knowing that we wanted to follow through on that story and that the show owed viewers that story.

Do you think this episode serves as a parallel for what's happening in our society?

Luddington: I do. It's amazing that the episode is airing right now because this storyline is about no longer feeling silent and about women finding the strength to use their voice to be heard, believed and feel empowered.

And feeling empowered and using your voice expands into other areas, which Ellen Pompeo did this week in THR's cover story about fighting for the pay she felt she deserved.

Luddington: I adore Ellen. I haven't read an interview in a long time that felt so honest. I appreciated her honesty and candor. Women like her are paving the way for asking what they're worth. We all should.

Vernoff: Like Ellen, I thought that story was gorgeous inside and out. What I loved about that story is that many actors, you meet them in life and read them in the press and it's two different people. This was like a conversation with Ellen — she brings her whole self, no filter, no falsehood.

Speaking of Pompeo, Meredith was instantly on Jo's side. Most women in Jo's position don't always get that kind of immediate support. Why was Meredith's response so important?

Vernoff: Meredith is the heart and soul of the show. And, in many ways, where Meredith goes, America goes too. When Meredith takes care of and believes Jo in this way, it is so powerfully moving that I find it hard to talk about. I think there is power in believing women and supporting women and holding women up and helping women through [sexual harassment]. Meredith Grey has an opportunity to teach and heal by just being who she is in this show and in the hearts and minds of the people who watch it.

Luddington: That played out amazing. The moment where Jo is watching Paul manipulate people and he is so charming and confident and suggesting that Jo, in her past, had not been believed? He finds subtle ways to undermine her — saying that she was a party girl and alcoholic. In that moment when Jo runs out from the gallery and interrupts them, she didn't believe Meredith would believe her. They had a rocky relationship in the past. But it was this incredible moment for Jo when Meredith turns around and tells her, ""I know who you are."" That's when Jo breaks down because I don't know how often — if ever — she's heard that.

Camilla, what was it like shooting this episode for you?

Luddington:I was anticipating shooting this episode for so long — it's been over a full season since Jo and viewers found out that she had an abusive ex-husband. I was nervous about the material because I felt the weight of it. [In preparing for the role], I was amazed at how many people have had this experience.

How did you prepare to portray Jo's reaction to being confronted by the man who abused her? You filmed a PSA for the National Domestic Violence Hotline at the end of this episode. Did you work with them on the story?

Luddington: Krista went back and forth with them and we sat down as a collective to talk about it. It was very important to make sure that the details and words we used in the dialogue gave the right message. It was a constant conversation between all of us about what these experiences are like because I haven't been through it. We had constant conversations for over a season about what domestic abuse looks like and feels like and how it affects the rest of your life and future relationships.

By making Paul a highly respected doctor — Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) had serious hero worship going on before she knew about Jo's experience — and casting him with a well liked actor like Morrison, are you also making a statement that what's inside doesn't always match what's on the outside?

Vernoff: I can't take credit for casting Matthew Morrison but it was a stroke of genius on [casting director] Linda Lowy's part to cast him. He's so likeable and affable. It has been both my experience in life and my understanding that people who are abusive almost always have a different face that they present to the world. Very often, good-looking, affable white men get a pass and people don't think that they're the monster. I appreciated the opportunity to tell this story with an actor who doesn't seem like a bad guy on first sight.

Jo and Alex (Justin Chambers) both say at different points that they wish Paul was dead. What will surprise viewers about how his story ends?

Vernoff: We have a lot of fun building twists and turns on the show and it doesn't end how you think it will based on the end of this episode.

Luddington: There are a lot of twists and turns that happen in the episode after this. I was very satisfied with how Krista wrapped it up.

What do you hope viewers take away from this episode and storyline?

Vernoff: I hope they take away a deeper understanding and compassion for how people end up in abusive relationships and how difficult it can be to get out of them. I hope they take away a commitment to help their friends — male and female — out of abusive relationships. I hope they take away a desire to help themselves out of any abusive relationship that they're in. That they feel seen because so many people feel so alone when they're living in this kind of abuse.

Luddington: We hope this storyline helps educate people about what domestic abuse is, what it looks like and brings awareness and a voice to it.

In terms of Jo's storyline, how will this experience change her going forward?

Luddington: It's finally going to hopefully be a weight lifted off her shoulders. She has navigated through her life always looking over her shoulder and she can now be at peace with herself and feel free. That's what I've hoped for her since season nine when we revealed her past. It's been a long time coming for the character. Jo will let go and walk through some of the pain of her past that she, until now, had held back and not wanted to address. Filing for divorce was a step in the right direction. She's going to feel some relief.

Brooke Stadler is Jo's real name. Will she go back to Brooke? Keep Jo? Take Karev's name if they get married?

Luddington: I've had this discussion with the writers. I wondered if she'd take Brooke back or keep Jo Wilson. What would happen one day down the road if she and Alex get married? I don't know what the writers have in store but personally I think Jo Karev has a nice ring to it! She's never had family and taking the name of someone she loves would represent family to her. We don't see many doctors on our show taking their spouse's names. We'll see!

Big Black’s pal Rob Dyrdek previously paid tribute to the former security guard. After the shocking news of his death, the pro skateboarder made several Instagram posts, revealing they had reconciled after a brief feud.

“My heart is broken. I don’t want to write this post. I don’t want to believe that this is reality.

The 22-year-old model gave a candid interview about her 'happy' life in a video for Vogue's 73 Questions series which was published Wednesday.

A horse stable served as the setting for the shoot as the beauty is an 'Olympic-class equestrian, who competed for 10 years.'

When asked who the most 'beautiful person' she knows is, the model didn't hesitate in saying 'my boyfriend.'

She also named her beau as the person who makes her 'laugh the hardest.'

Bella and R&B star The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) started dating in 2015 but broke up a year later. Over the summer in 2018 the couple reconciled and seem to be going strong.

486,"Kaitlyn Bristowe talks pressure to have 'perfect' body on 'The Bachelor' Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter SUBSCRIBE

June 22, 2017, 7:08 PM UTC / Source: TODAY By Gina Vivinetto

Kaitlyn Bristowe has had enough of reality TV's obsession with looks.

The former ""Bachelorette"" shared a ""real"" photo of herself on Instagram and opened up about the pressure to be ""perfect"" in its caption.

""I don't know if you noticed but it feels like if you go on 'The Bachelor,' your body has to be perfect and you have to post about it, like, a lot. Which is a ton of pressure,"" wrote Bristowe, 32, next to a photo of her wearing sweats and cozying up to her dog.

The candid star, who met fiancé Shawn Booth of season 11 of ""The Bachelorette,"" revealed that she had just finished several weeks of travel — including a fun trip to Mexico. ""I’m tired, run down, I’ve been eating hotel and airport food, I’m puffy, sick, and I had the time of my life,"" she wrote.

Bristowe said while in Mexico that she didn't feel like sharing a ""sexy"" bikini pic, explaining that, like everyone, she has body image issues.

""Yes. I'm tiny, but I have cellulite, and insecurities. I'm actually insecure about how scrawny my arms are. I work hard to be healthy, and love my body, but also drink wine and eat McDonalds. (Had it twice this week),"" she wrote.

Looking back, Bristowe wished she had shared a bikini pic, one ""without filtering or editing it, with a bad angle,"" or, as she called it, ""a good #Realstagram photo.""

""Because real is sexy too,"" she insisted.

To make up for it, Bristowe shared the pic of her and her dog, and told fans they'll soon her about her new project with Raw Beauty Talks, a non-profit that supports programs that increase self-esteem in youth.

She also encouraged them to post their own #Realstagrams.

""So here's my real pic. I'm run down, tired, greasy, full of McDonalds, but I had one of the best 3 weeks of my life,"" she wrote. ""Let's keep this movement going.""",1
487,"‘It totally belittled the moment’: Many look back in dismay at Trump’s tossing of paper towels in Puerto Rico The video clip has played on a repeating loop on cable news this week as Hurricane Florence closed in on the East Coast: President Trump casually tosses rolls of paper towels into a cheering crowd at a church in San Juan, Puerto Rico, after the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria a year ago.

White House aides reacted at the time with a mix of grimaces and chuckles over what they saw as classic Trump — acting insensitively but, in his own way, playfully to offer amusement to locals who were happy to see him. A pool reporter that day called the scene “surreal” and described Trump doing his “best Stephen Curry impersonation” as he aimed the towels to the far reaches of the crowd, a performance “they enjoyed.”

But nearly a year later, viewed in the prism of a new report about the lethal legacy of Maria, the moment last October does not seem as lighthearted. Trump’s day in San Juan — limited to the better fortified neighborhoods of the capital and far from the most catastrophic destruction — included other scenes that suggested the president was eager to congratulate himself prematurely and to minimize a rapidly deepening tragedy.

The paper-towel moment in particular has come to symbolize what critics say is Trump’s inability to sympathize with others — and his self-absorbed leadership in a time of crisis.

“One could argue it was nothing but then you could argue it was everything,” José Andrés, the celebrity chef who oversaw a massive operation to provide meals on the island, said in an interview Thursday. “It showed such a lack of empathy.”

Trump’s performance reminds some of a Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, who declared “mission accomplished” in May 2003 during a visit to an aircraft carrier supporting troops in the Iraq War — which would slog on eight more years. Two years later, Bush rushed to congratulate his Federal Emergency Management Agency director for a “heckuva job” in response to Hurricane Katrina, a storm that was blamed for the deaths of more than 1,800 people.

At the makeshift supply center last October at Calvary Chapel, Trump scoffed at a water purification kit that could help save lives. He awarded “A+” grades for his administration for its response to a pair of other hurricanes that struck Texas, Louisiana and Florida. And he characterized a death toll of 16 in Puerto Rico as a kind of victory, though the count would officially grow to 34 later in the day.

“There’s a lot of love in this room,” Trump, wearing a dark hooded windbreaker, boasted in the church.

Things look far more grim approaching Maria’s first anniversary. A report last month from George Washington University, commissioned by the Puerto Rican government, found that an estimated 2,975 more people died on the island in the six months following the storm than would have been expected under typical mortality rates — a figure that Puerto Rico’s governor accepted as the official death toll.

Trump, furious over what he considers revisionist history, has angrily watched the clips of him tossing paper towels on television and disputed the death numbers Thursday on Twitter, declaring it a conspiracy from Democrats.

But on the island, many residents have honed in on Trump’s moment at the church.

“That was disrespectful,” said Ramon Pachaco, 58, whose house in Ponce, on the island’s southern coast, suffered $26,000 in damage. Trump’s message to local residents, he said, amounted to: “If you want to cry, dry your tears with this.”

'We get an A+'

Maria wasn’t the only crisis the president was dealing with as he and first lady Melania Trump emerged from the White House just after 8 a.m. on Oct. 3, 2017, to start the day trip to San Juan.

Two days earlier, a gunman had slaughtered 58 people at an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas.

On the South Lawn, the president responded to shouted questions from reporters, calling the mass shooting a “tragedy.” Asked about Puerto Rico, Trump declared victory in an escalating feud with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who had criticized his administration’s response.

“It’s now acknowledged what a great job we’ve done,” Trump declared. “In Texas and in Florida, we get an A+. I think we’ve done just as good in Puerto Rico.”

White House aides viewed the president’s trip as an important visual counterbalance to his response to the storms on the mainland. Trump already had visited Texas and Florida, but he had appeared more callous toward Puerto Rico, criticizing the island’s poor infrastructure, including the electrical grid, and complaining that the cost of the emergency response would throw the federal budget “out of whack.”

To Mark Merritt, who served as a FEMA manager in the Clinton administration, Trump had already set the wrong tone for his visit.

“No one ever gives themselves a grade on disaster response,” said Merritt, who has served as a consultant for the Puerto Rico government over the past year. “The president should have come out and said, ‘This is the first truly catastrophic disaster in U.S. history. Never have we had a state that has been devastated with 100 percent of the state impacted.”

Aides had set up a full itinerary. The Trumps would meet with people affected by the storm, receive a briefing from local officials and greet U.S. sailors and Marines assisting in the recovery.

“I’ve been to Puerto Rico many times and the weather is second to none, but sometimes you get hit and you got hit,” Trump said, after disembarking Air Force One at a National Guard base in San Juan. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who had accompanied Trump, gave Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló a hug and an emphatic handshake. Rosselló, in contrast to the San Juan mayor, had spoken positively of the White House.

After a private briefing, the Trumps proceeded on a walking tour of the relatively affluent Guaynabo neighborhood, where they posed for photos with a local family.

Next stop was Calvary Chapel, for the carefully scripted photo op of Trump handing out supplies. It was something he had done a month earlier in a subdivision in Fort Myers, Fla., where he and the first lady, along with Vice President Pence, had passed out hoagies and bottled water to residents affected by Hurricane Irma.

As soon as Trump entered the church in San Juan, dozens of locals began cheering, snapping photos and straining to shake his hand.

'It totally belittled the moment'

Andrés was disgusted by Trump’s behavior in the church.

“You don’t throw them. You hand them,” he said of the paper towels. “You look the people in the eye and tell them, ‘We’re here for you, and we’ll do our best to provide relief for you and your family.’”

Current and former White House aides acknowledged that the imagery was unhelpful, overshadowing the breadth of the administration’s response. The federal government approved $1.39 billion in grants for more than 462,000 homeowners and renters, and the U.S. Small Business Administration authorized $1.8 billion in low-interest disaster loans, aides said.

“Our sense was that it was a good trip, the president did well, and a lot of the coverage was unfair,” said one former administration official, who spoke on anonymity to discuss the thinking of the president’s team.

The paper towel moment “was relatively minor and the media exploited it,” this person added.

Another former official argued that “the throwing of the paper towels was one of the funniest things of all time” and brought a bit of humor to an otherwise somber visit.

In the video, Trump can be seen throwing six rolls in 20 seconds, posing for a selfie in the middle of it. Then he picks up a different item and pretends to toss that to the crowd, drawing oohs.

“His inexperience and lack of understanding of the process made him feel like this is a campaign event,” Merritt said. “It totally belittled the moment and did more damage than good.”

Nearly a year later, White House aides have tried to keep Trump focused on the looming threat of Florence. More than 1.5 million people have been evacuated from coastal regions in the Southeast.

But the president has become increasingly infuriated by the focus on his San Juan trip, aides said. His tweets — arguing that Democrats inflated the official death count “to make me look as bad as possible” — have led to still more coverage, contributing to what aides described as a vicious cycle.

It’s a far cry from last October, as Air Force One streaked back from San Juan toward Washington and a triumphant Trump chatted with reporters on the plane.

Asked if he’d received any constructive criticism, the president replied: “None. They were so thankful for what we’ve done. I think it’s been a great day. No, we only heard thank yous from the people of Puerto Rico.”

489,"Charlize Theron on Playing a Female James Bond: I'm Very Old Charlize Theron has officially weighed in on the possibility of playing a female version of James Bond. Daniel Craig is still playing 007 for now, but James Bond 25, which is set to arrive in theaters next November, is said to be his last. That means, the franchise is heading for a reboot in the next couple of years and there's been talk, mostly from fans, about having a female Bond. Theron's name has been thrown around and now she's addressed the possibility.

During a recent interview, Charlize Theron was asked about playing James Bond. Nobody involved with the franchise, as far as we know, is actually looking at a female to play 007 in the future. Nor is there any indication Theron has been specifically approached, but her name has been bandied about, largely thanks to her roles in movies like Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde. Theron says she likes the idea of going against type, but she feels she's too old for the part. Here's what she had to say about it.

""You know, I don't have a feeling about it one way or the other. I love the idea that people are thinking outside the box. And I know for a long time people were talking about Idris Elba for it. And it's just nice to see people now thinking outside of [these] confined ideas of what we think a character can be. I'm really all for that. I think it's great that we are developing more characters within that genre for females, that they can take ownership. So it's a really nice thing for people to say. I'm very old, though. I would be a very old James Bond.""

Charlize Theron has made quite the name for herself as a female action star in recent years, so it's understandable that if a gender-swapped version of James Bond is on the horizon, her name would be at the top of people's lists. Some fan art depicting her as the iconic MI6 spy even made the rounds online last year. Gillian Anderson from The X-Files is also a favorite for the part and she's even shown support for the idea.

As Charlize Theron points out, Idris Elba has been a name thrown out over the years, which also would represent a change for the character, as James Bond has always been portrayed as a white man. In regards to her being too old? That's not necessarily true. Daniel Craig is going to be 50 by the time James Bond 25 gets going and Roger Moore played the part until he was 57. That said, Theron, who is now 42, would be in her mid-40s by the time the opportunity came up, which may be a bit old for someone to start their tenure as the new 007.

Related: Official James Bond 25 Title and Cast Announcement Coming Tomorrow

The producers of the James Bond franchise are going to have a tough time following up Daniel Craig and one way to gain some attention would be to try something different. Though, gender-swapping one of the most iconic characters in cinema history may turn more fans off than it would bring to the franchise. At the very least, some changes could be coming. Producer Barbara Broccoli said last year that she's open to have a female direct a future Bond movie, which could help bring some new perspective to the character and the franchise. In any event, it doesn't sound like Charlize Theron plans on putting on a tux and taking out bad guys with a Walther PPK in the future. This news comes to us courtesy of Yahoo.",1
490,"How Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson made Adam Levine cry Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson once made Adam Levine cry when they took some teasing too far.

The three music stars currently work as coaches on U.S. TV singing show The Voice alongside Alicia Keys, but they’ve actually all been pals for many years.

While Blake, Kelly and Adam aren’t afraid to engage in some good-natured banter onscreen,the country musician recalled during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Monday night a time when they got carried away with shenanigans after they watched Adam perform with his band Maroon 5 at a gig in Oklahoma several years ago.

“We had a designated driver because it was New Year’s Eve and we were drinking,” Blake said. “So, we went to his show, made fun of him, and when he got done, he came to stay at my house. And on the way back to the casino from my place, we got pulled over, we were in like a van, and we got pulled over by a deputy sheriff.”

Blake then explained that he and Kelly immediately launched into giving the cop a hard time. However, their behaviour stunned Adam, who was seriously concerned about their antics.

“Not that we don’t respect the police but we knew we hadn’t done anything wrong and so you can be a little cocky at that point,” the 41-year-old smiled. “And Adam didn’t see it that way because Adam’s from Los Angeles where you don’t talk back to the police. And in Oklahoma, if you’ve got a good point – you do sometimes. Especially Kelly, she was ribbing this guy (who) had a moustache that wasn’t cool looking. And Adam was convinced we were going to jail and he got upset. I’ll never forget it, (he was saying), ‘Kelly shut up, Kelly shut up.’ It got intense.”",1

Rachel Green’s (Jennifer Aniston) character’s disastrous dating life was particularly popular with viewers. While they could likely name several of Rachel’s former beaus, many are just now learning that Jennifer dated three of her Friends co-stars in real life.

She wasn’t romantic with David Schwimmer, who played her boyfriend Ross Gellar on the show. She also avoided getting involved with Matthew Perry, who played Chandler Bing, and Matt LeBlanc, who played Joey Tribbiani on the NBC sitcom.

Jennifer was, however, involved with Brad Pitt, Paul Rudd and Tate Donovan — all of whom appeared on at least one episode of Friends.

Jennifer and Brad were married from 2000 to 2005. He played Will Colbert in a single episode of Friends called The One With the Rumor.

Paul dated the Friends actress when he worked on a film called The Object of My Affection with her. He then appeared on Friends as Phoebe’s beau, Mike, through most of the final season.

Jennifer and Tate were engaged briefly, which comes as a shock to most dedicated Friends fans. He played Rachel's love interest Joshua on the show.

At the time, he and Jennifer had recently broken up, according to Huff Post Live.

‘We were broken up and the producers were like, “Hey would you wanna do six episodes of the show?” And I was like “Maybe it would be good to work through this breakup.”

‘It was horrible. It was so tough, man. I remember just getting back to my dressing room and just weeping.’

Can’t get enough of Jennifer Aniston’s romantic pursuits? Here’s all you need to know about all that and more.

Are Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston married?

Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt were married from 2000 to 2005. They both moved on after the divorce.

Brad married Angelina Jolie and Jennifer married Justin Theroux.

Recently, rumors have been swirling that Jennifer and Brad are getting back together — perhaps even remarried. It appears, however, that there’s no truth to those rumors.

In fact, Jennifer laughed them off in an interview with InStyle.

Jennifer Aniston husband

Jennifer Aniston is separated from husband Justin Theroux. The pair announced their separation in 2018, revealing that they made the decision a few months prior.

The reason for their split remains a mystery to the public.

Does Jennifer Aniston have kids?

Jennifer Aniston does not have children. She recently spoke openly with InStyle about the rumors and added pressure she’s felt because she’s not a mother.

She said: ‘No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors.

‘No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally. There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods.’

Jennifer continued: ‘Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do?’",1

494,"Aly and AJ Michalka Opened Up About Their 10-Year Break From Music Aly Michalka and her younger sister AJ Michalka had a certified hit “Potential Breakup Song” in 2007, which was named Time’s 9th best song of the year. They briefly released songs after that under the name 78Violet, but it’s been long ten years since the duo released a song as Aly & AJ. Last Friday, the two sisters debuted a new single, “Take Me,” according to E! News.

Over the last decade, the former child stars went for acting. Aly, 28, is married to Stephen Ringer and stars on iZombie. While AJ, 26, is a series regular on the sitcom The Goldbergs.

In a recent interview with Elle, the Michalka sisters opened up about what happened, where they’ve been and what brought them back to their music career.

“My husband encouraged us to come back to music,” Aly explained. “He saw us singing and writing round the house so he encouraged us to get back out there and write music and perform…[Finally] we just said, ‘Okay, let’s give this one last go.'”

The pair then called out their good friend and songwriter Mike Elizondo and started to settle things.

“The music we were writing then was based on fictional relationships. We were thirteen and fifteen, we were writing with zero experience,” Aly said referring to their new and mature sound. “Now that I’m married, and we’ve each had many relationships and heartbreaks, we’re coming at songwriting at a much different way.”

AJ also talked about what it was like to be a child star. “I don’t think we were [in the] mega stardom field, but I do know that our music had done well enough that Aly and I were recognized on a day-to-day basis, especially if we were together,” the sitcom star revealed.

She added, “You deal with constant scrutiny, and people who know your business too intimately who shouldn’t. As a kid, it can be overwhelming and frightening. Now that we’re older, I feel safer. I know how to handle it better. Had we been bigger at that age, it can be really freaky and possibly damaging.”

The younger sister admits that she’s thankful they’re not superstars. “Had we been bigger at that age, it can be really freaky and possibly damaging. I’m glad we didn’t experience Taylor Swift-level fame because I don’t know how that would work,” the actress shared. “Thankfully we had each other; I can’t imagine it as a solo artist. [Even] growing up with super-normal parents and a solid team around us, being under the microscope is definitely a weird way to grow up.”

Aly also said that she was completely open for a Phil of the Future reunion. “I mean, sure! I guess reunions are a big thing now. I wouldn’t be opposed to it. It’s a funny idea. I have no idea what they’d do necessarily with the storyline, but yeah, sure.”

Aly & AJ’s four-song EP is scheduled to be released before a full album in 2018.",1

496,"Christian Isn't Naked In 'Fifty Shades Freed' Nearly As Much As Ana Is & That's Actually A Serious Problem Going into the third and final installment in the Fifty Shades franchise, fans have one very important question: is there D in Fifty Shades Freed? The degree of Christian Grey's nudity has been hotly debated ever since Fifty Shades of Grey hit theaters in 2015, with many hoping that there'd be substantial nude shots of actor Jamie Dornan in the series, considering that his co-star, Dakota Johnson, is frequently seen naked in the movies. But Dornan stayed mostly covered up in both Grey and the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, and unfortunately, the latest film, Fifty Shades Freed, squanders a chance for equal-opportunity nudity.

As a dominant, Christian Grey does not like to take his clothes off during sex. This fact was well established in Fifty Shades of Grey, hence the internet declaring his red room jeans his ""f*ck jeans."" As a boyfriend, Christian, as seen in Fifty Shades Darker, was a little more willing to get naked, though the movie only showed him nude in the afterglow and only from the waist up or from behind. In Fifty Shades Freed, the now-husband Christian is definitely comfortable taking his clothes completely off in the bedroom, but, again, the audience sees only his butt, a choice Dornan was apparently comfortable with. ""You see my arse quite a lot,"" Dornan said in an interview with Elle. ""I just thought, we don't need to be flashing the rest if it's not essential to the story.""

Dornan is right when he says that nudity for nudity's sake is unnecessary, but this defense only goes so far before it becomes a double standard. Johnson's Anastasia Steele was a slight angle shift away from giving the audience a full frontal look in both Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker. And even though she and Dornan are on somewhat equal-nudity footing in Fifty Shades Freed, the fact remains that, as a whole, the franchise is heavily tilted towards female nudity. ""There is a lot more of my body that's shown than Jamie's,"" Johnson said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, and it's true; in Freed, for instance, Johnson is shown naked constantly. If nudity is OK when required for the story, the question then becomes, why is more female nudity necessary to Fifty Shades while male nudity is not? The answer: men.

Speaking of the decision to leave Christian's bottom half out of Fifty Shades Darker, director James Foley told Cosmopolitan that it ""wasn't on purpose. It was just where the camera was."" In Hollywood, an industry driven by men, male nudity is more taboo than female nudity. Every single Fifty Shades movie had a male director of photography, and the last two films were directed by men. In other words, the movies were quite literally shot with a male gaze. Is it any wonder, then, that these men simply did not think to include more of Christian's body, while showcasing so much of Ana's?

A report published in 2016 found that women are three times more likely to be naked on screen than men in major Hollywood movies. Looking at the top 100 films at the 2014 domestic box office, ""The Report on the Status of Women and Girls in California"" from Mount Saint Mary's University, found that 29 percent of female characters appeared ""partially or fully nude"" compared to only nine percent of male characters.

Moreover, the Motion Picture Association of America that gives ratings to movies has also recently made specifications in their ratings for ""male nudity,"" as opposed to the gender-neutral ""nudity"" warning. Examining movies cited for ""nudity"" by the MPAA between 2006-2010, Jezebel found that of the 786 movies that earned the warning, three were cited as featuring ""male nudity,"" and none were cited as having ""female nudity."" The fact that the MPAA felt it had to specify when certain films included ""male nudity"" reflects an American taboo. Female nudity is normalized, while male nudity is seen as an oddity or, in the case of the MPAA, a specific offense.

If it had given the audience more male nudity, Fifty Shades Freed could have helped shift how the MPAA and audiences view nudity. Equal opportunity nudity in Hollywood should be standard — for every full frontal naked woman on screen, there should be a full frontal naked man. The only way to achieve that is to begin normalizing male nudity on screen. And, yes, that will mean showing some D.",1

498,"The Real Housewives of New York City Season 9 Episode 22 News Which TV series will your friends (and the entire internet) be talking about this week? Stay informed — or at least be able to fake it — with SideReel's weekly guide to The Most Important Shows on TV. The Real Housewives of New York City (Reunion Part 3) Wednesday at 8 p.m. on Bravo Why: Any Housewives enthusiast knows that the real action happens during the 3rd reunion! We've already talked about Tom (and sadly this was filmed before the official split), the election, Bethenny's emotional state, Tinsley's drinking...so what's left? Well, if you know Andy Cohen and Bravo reunions at all, the answer is obviously rehashing the Ramona/Bethenny drama for the 7,000th time (even though they already mostly made up in Mexico). Duh! And we're here for it! They'll also revisit that glorious Mexico trip and hopefully replay clips of Luann tripping and falling no fewer than 20 more times. We're just bummed you can no longer find Ramona Pinot Grigio anywhere to bring to the party (it actually wasn't half bad). Prepare to talk about: When we'll actually get more dirt on Luann's divorce; whether we think Tinsley will make the cut for next season (we vote yes). Narcos (Season Premiere) Friday at 3 a.m. on Neflix Why: Spoiler alert (but not really since this happened for real, and in 1993 no less): Pablo Escobar is dead. While this may seem like there is no longer a show here, it is actually an exciting opportunity for a reboot! Season 3 of Narcos will focus on Escobar's real life successors, the Cali Cartel, referred to at the time as the ""new kings of coke"" (and we don't mean soda). Pedro Pascal is returning as DEA agent Javier Pena and will be joined by a handful of new castmembers including Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Kerry Bishe ( Halt and Catch Fire ), and Miguel Angel Silvestre ( Sense8 ). We can't deny that we'll miss our favorite anti-hero, but we're certainly willing to give a new crop of villains a chance to leave their mark! Prepare to talk about: How much of this stuff actually happened (a lot of it, says Netflix, but we're sure you'll still be googling); which drug lord is...best? Twin Peaks (Series Finale) Sunday at 8 p.m. on Showtime Why: This show has been oh so strange and confusing, but also unlike anything else on TV right now, which is if nothing else an accomplishment (thanks, David Lynch). Some people view it as a masterpiece. *And* it has finally started to make SO MUCH MORE SENSE! Granted, it will almost certainly end with a thousand unanswered questions, but we know we can expect a Good Cooper vs. Bad Cooper showdown and an answer as to Audrey's fate. Has she been in a coma? An institution? It will all become clear. Prepare to talk about: Who lived and who died; what was real and what was fake; is this show done now for real, or will it be back again in 25 more years? Rachel is the product manager of SideReel, and her favorite drug lord will always be Walter White. div.post p { text-align: justify; }",1
499,"Serena Williams and fiance Alexis Ohanian introduce daughter Alexis Olympia Tennis star Serena Williams and fiance Alexis Ohanian have officially introduced their daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.

Williams, 35, took to her Instagram page to share a photo of the baby, who was born Sept. 1, as well as videos from various stages in her pregnancy.

The 6-pound, 14-ounce newborn, who has an Instagram handle of her own (@olympiaohanian), left the hospital after nearly a week, according to her mother, who said in the footage, which was also posted to Ohanian's YouTube channel, ""we had a lot of complications.""

""Welcome, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., we're so happy to meet you,"" Ohanian, 34, wrote today in an Instagram caption. ""Our little girl is already mama's perfect sidekick.""

This is the first child for Williams and Reddit co-founder Ohanian, who got engaged in December. The couple announced they were expecting in April.

The confirmation came after Williams shared a photo of her pregnant stomach on Snapchat with the caption, ""20 weeks.""

Williams said in July that the time off from tennis was a welcome change of pace.

“I’ve never had this time off before, or if I have I’ve been injured and it’s really different to be injured as opposed to be expecting,” she told ABC News. “I’ve been really enjoying my time off and getting ready for this new massive chapter in my life.”

ABC News' Katie Kindelan contributed to this report.
